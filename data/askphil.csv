To me ethical nihilism however appears to make a lot more sense. I was wondering on which basis do philosophers prefer ethical naturalism and how do they reconcile the following point. 

Existential philosophy proposes that there is no inherent meaning in our existence and that we ought to invent our own subjective meaning.

17,"Hi there. I have a question on Descartes and I was hoping I could find some anwers here. 

Descartes has a few arguments for the pineal gland (PG) being the seat of the soul.
He has anatomical arguments:
The PG ist the seat of the soul because
- it is the only thing/ organ (in the brain) which is not double and impressions from doubble sense organs (eyes, ears) must be single since we only can have one thought at a time. So the (single) PG merges the impressions into one impression/ thought
- it has a conducive position in the brain for receiving impressions (it is well suited, central and protected location, small size, incomparable mobility)

Then Descartes argues with an analogical argument:
The PG is the seat of the soul because
- the soul is single and indivisible and the PG is not devided into two parts. 
Because of that both are comfortable for one another, the structural analogy brings them together. 

Now. I think it‚Äòs clear that these arguments are not plausibel but I can‚Äòt really argue why.

20,"I‚Äôve been reading a lot of Lovecraftian horror lately. I‚Äôve grown deeply interested in the idea that there are things ‚Äúout there‚Äù which are completely independent of any human conception, taken to the point of where there is a much greater ‚Äúreality‚Äù which is incomprehensible.

I‚Äôve had a lay interest in philosophy and cognitive science for awhile, but I haven‚Äôt really engaged with philosophy for the last year. So some topics I‚Äôve read about before make this facet of Lovecraftian horror seem intuitive at first glance, but then I‚Äôm thrown in for a loop when I seriously examine it.

For example, to me, it‚Äôs easy to accept that there can exist things that are incomprehensible, or ‚Äúhigher truths‚Äù that are inaccessible because we simply are not equipped to perceive them or even begin to reason about them. We lack the faculties. But then I question what that entails epistemically and ontologically.

For example (while avoiding getting bogged down in the details), Descartes and Kant seem to consider the prospect of a ‚Äúgreater‚Äù reality inaccessible from our comprehension, but only for the sake of bringing back some assurance that we can form reliable conclusions. It seems like a premature neutering of the concept of the incomprehensible to bring the question of a ‚Äúgreater reality‚Äù back down to human comprehension. And then I think about anthropocentrism and skeptical ideas in the philosophy of science, and I‚Äôm all the more confused. I‚Äôm not really interested in surmounting the question of to what extent we should grant credence to our conclusions in the face of a fallible perception, or why/how we should or could trust our conclusions. I‚Äôm more interested in what the prospect of inaccessible realities and ‚Äúgreater truths‚Äù can implicate about the nature of existence. 

I hope I didn‚Äôt inadvertently posit any strong ideas or ramble incoherently. I didn‚Äôt sleep, and as I wrote earlier, I‚Äôm only a layman and haven‚Äôt read much philosophy for the last year. I‚Äôm just looking for pointers to be less confused about the whole thing.

The pessimism I've read is: Ligotti's conspiracy against the human race, Benatar's better never to have been, Zappfe's the last messiah and Mainlander  from excerpts online, these are the philosophers and works I'm looking for criticism against, have there been any papers/books specifically addressed to them?

I understand that it is particularly challenging to translate analytic philosophy into any other language given the structure of English and how it renders itself to analytic prose, and especially Farsi which is so poetic and utterly continental.

He came back after eating, started asking for me, ignored, he began to walk over me, he got tired and slept too.

I had three opportunities to get up and start my routine, but I didn't. I wasn't feeling that tired, I technically got enough sleep. All I wanted was for that moment to last. I was clingy to it. The same way I'm doing now listening to the same song on repeat while writing this piece.

I decided not to give in to self criticism when I fail to do what I'm supposed to. Because after all I'm not failing, I'm simply not doing anything. That's worse, because when you try and fail you learn. But I decided not to turn against myself anymore.

Hi  , I am a young Arab . I have always believed in one's responsibility to  be up to date and unbiased (as much as a person can ) on important  subjects.

A particular subject  about which ive had multiple opinions , and which seems to have no  positive outlook is the isreali- arab conflict.

I'll lay out my thoughts here , please feel free to criticize and to give your own opinions.

1-  Isreal should have never been established in the Palestinian mandate.  After checking up on the historical context. I came to the conclusion  that jews needed a place to live in peace after ww2 . They , however ,  had no tangible moral or legal right to form a state in an area which  was already inhabited and very anxious about them taking over.

2-  Zionisim is an ultra-nationalist idealogy and has no right to call  itself 'moral' or 'right'. While zionisim has been the leading jewish  political movement , it has no inherent 'morally superior 'value. It  advocates for a nation for jews , where the jewish citizen gets   priority over the others. This obviously is not right . This is proven  by the fact that isreal refuses to  give citizenship to 50% of the  residents within it's borders (the arabs). residents and to ignore their  due process and human rights. West bank and gaza feel like the warsaw  ghetto , isolated , choking economically and demographically under the  weight of the isreali blockade.  Sudden isreali raids into gaza to take  suspects by force apparently always leavng collateral damage ,the real  life stories of teenagers who have spent decades in prison without a  formal charge have made me understand why the palestenians fight back  when these raids occur.

4-  Zionisim has absorbed extremist jewish ideologies. First , i dont see a  reason to dismiss the idea of the 'extremist jew', unless judiasim has  some special qualities which I cant seem to observe. moving on , during  my visit I witnessed jewish settelers moving into the aqsa with the  company of armored guards , while actually shoving and kicking  palestenians out of the way. This has no justification and is a symptom  of the extremism in isreal . Said extremisim is why palestenians are  being forced out of their houses and replaced with jewish 'settlers' (  replacing the local population in territory you annexed  is a  war crime  btw). These actions cannot be propagated by a liberal state , only a  fundamentalist one.

Of course not  to mention the illegal settlements that are being built all around to  absorb the annexed territory. Putin is trying to do the same in ukraine  but apparently he doesnt get to while israel can.While I believe that  Lavrov is a lying serpent he had a point when he asked the international  community to view ukraine as palestine . Because putin wishes to absorb  ukraine the same way isreal is absorbing paslestine

5-  The indiscriminate bombing of palestenian civilians and the plethora of  other human right violations prove that isreal is not liberal.

6-  Isreal IS a democracy , it however is democracy where all the  candidates are different flavors of ultra nationalism , and where the  far right dominates anyhow as the population itself is extremist.

All  this has lead me to the conclusion that isreal is not so different from  it's arab neighbors, or from it's other fundamentalist peers such as  taliban afghanistan . The only difference I see is economical , has  isreal been impoverished like the arabic world it wouldnt look any  different from syria , or iraq.

As always thanks for reading. I realize that I am draawing from personal observation , which is anecdotal to you .

I  realize that the palestenisans have extremist organizations as well but  I must stress that here I am trying to understand isreal.","Greetings, would you help a confused bloke ?",askphilosophy

My conclusion after meeting far too many people with the opinion that philosophy is useless, is that the individuals do not seem to understand what philosophy is, or the history of philosophy, but telling them they have a deficit in understanding is hardly useful. While I didn't have a lot of time to explore the ideas or apply my rather frail attempt at elenchus (although I believe Socrates proved that it pisses people off more than it changes their mind), I conclude with Nietzsche's affirmation, that ""Christianity is Platonism for the masses"".

My personal opinion is that philosophy is needed more than ever, not only do I think the issues the world (meso level) is facing have grown ever more complex, but simultaneously we seem to have recessed to a state of squabbling sophistry at a macro level (politics) and reject abstract, higher thinking as a valuable skill to be taught or nurtured in the people at the micro level (individuals). Mind you, that could be a little bit of Nietzschean thinking seeping through.

The main issue is that I have no idea how to enunciate to someone with little understanding of what philosophy is, or the importance and use of philosophy in history, at the various levels, individual to cultural. How does one go about approaching such a point? Or is this something you explain over the campfire on a camping trip with hours to spare? There's so many routes to approach it from, historical, logical, moral, etc and even practical, a study here in Aus a while ago found that Philosophy graduates end up with some of the best mid career earnings of all topics in the arts.",How do you respond to individuals who consider philosophy a useless subject?,askphilosophy

59,"In my critical theory course way long ago, the professor mentioned that the early critical theorists of the Frankfurt School were concerned about the revival of fascism in Europe and therefore intentionally sought to avoid what might be called the temptation or desire to write utopian writings, because such writings might lead a society down the path to fascism, i.e. via an unnoticed toxic power structure appearing within that utopia, like for example the rise of Hitler and/or Stalin and the unprecedented effects that they had on history.

So I was under the impression that Frankfurt era critical theorists will use Marx to imply that his ""criticism of everything existing"" was in line with their own goal, BUT that the utopian projects following this criticism might have to be themselves properly criticized in order to change the world.

So I feel like there's a tension and I want to explore it in my own way, but I would prefer to start with reading other writers. Can a critical theory be utopian? Is utopia always an attempt for perfection, or can it be an approximation, can you have a critical or pragmatic utopia? Does critical theory limit itself by refusing the desire to operate on a utopian level?

I'm wondering if this tension is related to the question, ""should we create a new society that does away with what is bad, or should we criticize and change our present society through critique?"" (I put it in so many words, but the main idea is can we overcome capitalism by creating a better society and leaving capitalism behind, or must we absolutely destroy it and reduce it to nothing, and build new from the ashes?)

However this idea seems to contradict the lived experience of many transgender people, especially trans people who experience dysphoria.  Many trans people describe themselves as ""men in women's bodies"" or ""women in men's bodies.""  The implication of this is that some people have a fixed gender identity that exists regardless of how they behave or present in society.

 P1. Everything that begins to exist has a cause.

P2. The physical universe (everything that is physical) could not be caused by something physical, without being self-caused, since that physical thing would be within the physical universe, and thus the physical universe would be self-caused.

P3. The idea that a physical thing could be self-caused is absurd, because physical causation happens in time, and for a physical thing to be self-caused, it would need to have existed before it actually came into being, in order to cause itself.


C1. Therefore, the physical universe could not be caused by something physical.

P4. Something non-physical could not cause something physical, since the non-physical and the physical have no bearing on each other. Therefore, the physical universe could not have been caused by something non-physical.

C2. Since the cause of the universe must be either physical or non-physical (since those are exhaustive), but both lead to an absurdity, the universe could not be caused. But since everything that begins to exist must have a cause and the universe doesn't, then the universe was uncaused, or eternal.

128," Hi, I am trying to understand how to analyze disposition attributes to for ‚ÄúFunctional Analysis‚Äù \[3\] which is used in engineering create designs for new systems. But I am getting stuck reading ""A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive"" by J.S. Mill. Here is a snippet from the book which describe how an attribute is analyzed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;‚ÄúWhen, on the other hand, the abstract name does not express a complication of attributes, but a single attribute, we must remember that every attribute is grounded on some fact or phenomenon, from which, and which alone it derives its meaning. To that fact or phenomenon, called in a former chapter the foundation of the attribute, we must, therefore, have recourse for its definition. Now the foundation of the attribute may be a phenomenon of any degree of complexity, consisting of many different parts, either coexistent or in succession. To obtain a definition of an attribute, we must analyze the phenomenon into these parts. Eloquence, for example, is the name of one attribute only; but this attribute is grounded on external effects of a complicated nature, flowing from acts of the person to whom we ascribe the attribute; and by resolving this phenomenon of causation into two parts, the cause and effect, we obtain a definition of eloquence, viz. the power of influencing the feelings by speech or writing.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;\- J.S. Mill ""A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive‚Äù Page 108. \[2\]

&amp;#x200B;

What‚Äôs confusing me is how to explain the attribute, is it enough to find out the answer to ‚ÄúWhy is the person eloquent?‚Äù? and also for any dispositional attribute, is it enough to find the answer to ‚ÄúWhy is the person disposed to make cake?‚Äù or any other disposition for example?

132,"Conservatism is defined as a cultural and social philosophy of preserving historical traditions and practices. But applying historical traditioins simply because they're historical in the modern world doesn't really work. 

The world is constantly changing, tradition is finally being challenged (luckily) and we're questioning why we do things. Doing something today because it worked a long time ago is an extremely weird argument in my opinion because the world was wildly different.

And there's a difference between doing something that we did in the past and also do now vs. doing something just because it worked in the past. The latter is conservatism but the former can be for example washing our hands after going to the bathroom, we do it because it has a scientific basis not out of some desperate attempt to cling on to the past.

So is there any logic behind this? I believe the world is constantly changing and even if we all collectively decide to freeze societal progress, it won't happen. That is because nature and earth is constantly changing and we can't possibly preserve the same state of society amidst a completely different earth.

As far as whether we're in a simulation or not, I would posit we might be in the illusion of one.

God here is defined as a being that is omnipotent, omniscient, morally perfect an exists necessarily

I am concerned mainly with this bit. At minute 14 he argues that even if God exists, the proposition God does not exist does not contradict itself. Sure, it would contradict other propositions, but it does not contradict itself. Hence, there are possible worlds in which this is the case

I do not understand this. Sure, the proposition 'God does not exist' alone is coherent, and may be true in some possible worlds. But if indeed is the case that God does exist, he must exist necessarily, which would entail that the statement 'God does not exist' is not true in any possible world.

He then goes on to give some statements that are not self-contradictory, such as 'a being whose nonexistence is self-contradictory if it exists doesn't exist'

Isn't this statement self-contradictory, however? There are two possibilities, either this being exists or he doesn't. If he exists we have a contradiction because 'if he exists he doesn't exist.' If he doesn't exist we also have a contradiction because the sentence states that the nonexistence of this being is self-contradictory.

And since the ""self"" doesn't exist, there's only one thing that does exist - consciousness, and when we ""die"", we never realise it and consciousness keeps continuing. The only thing that does "" Die"" When we die is the individual conscious which is soon replaced. 

All the pain and suffering that humans go through doesn't ""end"" when you die because you don't realise it. Death doesn't make anything better. The damage done through suffering is done.

**Why is human intervention in nature bad unless it's beneficial to us in some way, or the environment as a whole, but never individual animals?**

For example, we're killing spotted lanternflies **to save our crops**, and parasite-carrying giant african snails **to protect people from disease**. We also intervene with invasive species **to save others from extinction**. But we never take into consideration ***the wellbeing of individual animals***.

On the other hand, the idea of saving prey animals from predators is generally frowned upon. So intervention **to reduce animal suffering** is *not* okay.

And from that question I could also ask:

* Why is the wellbeing of individual animals never an option or a priority here?
* Why is extinction of a species considered a worse outcome than the mass killing of animals?
* Why are our human interests put above the wellbeing of other living things? (Like in the case of insects damaging crops or another industry)
* Is this basically the trolley problem?

I've read a bit on animal ethics, animal rights and animal welfare but I haven't found any explanation on why we as humans have decided to take these stances.

Often one can learn from others' mistakes/failures but it is easier and more efficient to learn from one's own mistakes/failures, generally speaking. 

Thus, making a mistake/failure by oneself is usually more productive and essential if a goal of oneself is *'self-growth'* rather than learning from others' mistake/failures for *self-growth.* 

On the contrary, when faced with the decision to either, the most ethical and moral decision isn't obvious:

 A) Allow one to make mistake/fail, despite having the tools and resources to stop ones mistake/failure, as an effort to maximize ones potential to reach their goal of *'self-growth.'* 

OR

B) Stop ones mistake/failure using the resources and tools you've learned from you're own mistakes/failures, but in turn minimizing ones potential to to reach their goal of '*self-growth'*

**Constants:** 

1) None of the mistakes/failures are life or death situations for any of the involved parties nor indirect third parties

2) None of the mistakes will cause severe or chronic detrimental injury or illness to any of the involved parties no indirect third parties

3) The outcome of learning from the mistake/failure will always the ability to result in a net-positive towards the goal of '*self-growth'*

222,"&gt;This is the great lesson the depressive learns: Nothing in the world is inherently compelling. Whatever may be really ‚Äúout there‚Äù cannot project itself as an affective experience. It is all a vacuous affair with only a chemical prestige. Nothing is either good or bad, desirable or undesirable, or anything else except that it is made so by laboratories inside us producing the emotions on which we live. And to live on our emotions is to live arbitrarily, inaccurately‚Äîimparting meaning to what has none of its own. Yet what other way is there to live? Without the ever-clanking machinery of emotion, everything would come to a standstill. There would be nothing to do, nowhere to go, nothing to be, and no one to know. The alternatives are clear: to live falsely as pawns of affect, or to live factually as depressives, or as individuals who know what is known to the depressive. How advantageous that we are not coerced into choosing one or the other, neither choice being excellent. One look at human existence is proof enough that our species will not be released from the stranglehold of emotionalism that anchors it to hallucinations. That may be no way to live, but to opt for depression would be to opt out of existence as we consciously know it.

223,"I've been thinking about the idea of causation. I would like to suggest that causation is an emergent property of time and space.

Causation has two components, cause and effect. In order that a cause results in an effect, time passes with the cause always preceding the effect, and temporal space exists in which the cause and effect take place. For example:

I throw a ball against the side of the barn. The ball leaves my hand, *time* passes between the release and the bounce, and the ball travels through temporal *space* in order that the effect takes place.

Both time and space exist because of the Big Bang. Therefore, the logic undergirding causation are dependent upon the 'container'. Cause and effect need time and space.

This causes me to question the logic of KCA. Reading the temporal rules within the Universe do not inform us of the process of causation outside of the Universe. How can cause and effect exist without time or space in which to function?

So my working conclusion is that KCA depends on the fallacy of composition/division: Conclusions about dogs don't necessarily inform us on conclusions about all four-legged animals. Or, as my favorite logical fallacy website says: ""P1: My cells are invisible to the naked eye, P2: I am entirely composed of cells, C: My opponents will not be able to see me in a game of hide and seek. ([https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/composition-division](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/composition-division))

So instead of KCA, how about an alternative:

1. P1: Causation requires both time and space.
2. P2: Time and space only exist because of the Big Bang.
3. C: The Big Bang was not caused.

I'm not much for philosophy, so I'd love to hear other POV on this. Are there any logical fallacies in my argument, or any ways to improve on the premises or conclusion?","Cause/Effect, Time/Space, and an Alternative to KCA",askphilosophy

Hi Reddit, 

I refer to the quote above. How do you interpret this? More specifically, 1) how do you remain good and kind even when being these behaviours are negatively reinforced? 2) then how should you teach your children?

I made the moral decision to do something altruistic for the greater good of the community (reported somebody for harrassment), and yet suffered from the consequences of it (punishment and exile). 

So if we look at this quote, how should we rationalise this so we don't end up ultimately becoming merely transactional in our relationships?

I see how that refutes the notion that any given disproof is final and not open to further criticism. However, what it does not seem to do is refute hypothetical falsifiability as a key criterion for science (while practical absolute falsification is shown by this to be impossible, it doesn‚Äôt dispute the notion that there should at least be some way for you to be demonstrated to be potentially incorrect for your theory to have any relevance). Furthermore, if anything it only supports the his notion that science is the act of repeatedly criticising everything - it simply means that each disproof is itself open to being disproved, something which from my understanding doesn‚Äôt conflict with his argument anyway.

As far as I can tell, there is no part of it that fundamentally refutes Popper‚Äôs account of science as the act of subjecting each theory to the maximum amount of criticism possible, nor as to the importance of being able to distinguish (at least hypothetically) between a theory being true or not through hypothetical falsification.

The Relativity Theory shifts the former understanding and scientific view of space and time into a more subjective and relative perspective which seems to have played a pretty big role. Did he become such an icon maybe because of his perspective in general? As far as I know, he himself reached for publicity a good amount which could've then resulted in one of the reasons he became such a public figure. How to implement socialism into our worldwide capitalistic society is such a complex question and no one actually knows if, how and over which timespan this could work out. Maybe it's not about forcefully changing the rules of the system by going full-communism again or something like that\^\^ but rather trying to make a change as an individual by trying to be more social and change in some way and as a probably democratic society (at least in Germany :D). I think if people could acquire this mindset more with maybe the help of some technology or only a more reworked way of today's social media this could be a starting point to individuals being more social in their own small circle to spread this positive effect. Would people be less extreme in their political minds and vote for politicians that are more motivated by morals and generally more connected to the people? I think there could be a pivot point that could lead away from the capitalistic society by politicians' mindsets that aim toward socialism. How could this be done and is it possible to apply something like that to the whole international capitalistic world order? There are unbelievably many steps for a shift in this direction and you can't really make a science out of that but my assumption is that capitalism and the imbalance that goes with it is a problem that could be changed by the politicians that have control over the economy(although for a limited degree) which are voted by a more social and maybe more happy society.

&gt; It is at this point that mention must be made of the *vanishingly* small number of legitimate exceptions to this rule.
&gt; 
&gt; One such are hermaphrodites- individuals born with both male and female sex organs. In non-human biology, this sort of thing is [actually pretty common](https://infogalactic.com/info/Hermaphrodite). But in humans, with our very clear sexual dimorphism, hermaphroditism (known these days by the mealy-mouthed politically correct term ‚Äúintersex‚Äù) is *extremely* rare.
&gt; 
&gt; [No particularly good figures exist](https://infogalactic.com/info/Intersex#Population_figures) that tell us exactly how many hermaphrodites exist in the world, mostly because the exact definition and gradation of true hermaphroditism is very imprecise. But we can safely conclude that less than 0.05% of the general population falls into this category.
&gt; 
&gt; Another are [*true* transgenders](http://judgybitch.com/2015/01/05/on-being-transgender/), in the sense that they were born with the brain chemistry of one sex but the actual physical organs of another.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, this is an *exceedingly* rare condition, caused by a highly unusual birth defect that results in chromosomal abnormalities.
&gt; 
&gt; Where our society has gone truly and horribly wrong is in arguing that such rare and legitimate medical conditions now make it right and just to argue that any mentally ill man or woman who ‚Äúfeels‚Äù himself, or herself, to be of ‚Äúthe wrong gender‚Äù can now simply *become* the ‚Äúright‚Äù one.

""The best metaphor for this idea I can find is the world of computing. Suppose you have a simulation with the number of agents or ""bots"" x in a 2D plane with obstacles like in the real world. The computer has to go through each agent separately and completely focus on his point of view in the simulator - the memory stored in one bot will not be available to another in the source code. however, it is the same processor that jumps between all agents and pretends to be only one agent. The only meaningful way to talk about it is to define the duality of the two properties of reality - the observer and the ego. They are both properties of consciousness, but we often confuse them. The observer is the reason you are more than a walking biological machine with the incredible computer power of neurons and hormones. there is only one observer who is observing from every point in the universe. While it only absorbs memory and information from where it is - it will not remember that it was in a body other than the body it is in at the moment. Different bodies and individuals that we perceive as having their own observer actually share the same observer - but have a different ego. ego is identity. it is your point of view, your reality, your memory, your beliefs and your experiences, and your present. The ego is the illusion of being a specific brain cell when in fact you are the whole human being. The ego is an illusion you had last night where the dream you lived in was all you can know. The ego is the illusion you have now that you are a specific person, living a specific life in a specific universe, with specific rules and a specific result when you are all reality. let's say you sit in a chair with 100 cameras watching the city of London. now you clearly can't see all the images at once, and you probably can't even remember what you saw on the last camera because you're too focused on viewing the current camera. When you look through the camera, you imagine yourself standing exactly where the camera is looking - you identify yourself as the camera sitting on the roof when you are the human sitting in the chair. Now the different identities you go into for each camera you watch are the ego. it is the illusion that you are not a man in a chair, but a camera sitting in a certain corner on the London Underground, while the observer is a man in a chair who is technically any camera he has ever watched over. now there is no objective reality as we know it. reality as a whole is infinite, and your reality and mine are sub-realities, just like any fictional reality.""

&amp;#x200B;

\-One reason is: I believe without knowing science, philosophy becomes empty. So maybe we should start doing philosophy in our scientific fields, without learning philosophy as a separate field.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if you want to do the philosophy of cosmology, you should know cosmology. Now, in theory, a philosophy major can learn cosmology without having a cosmology/physics degree. But in reality, people who have a degree in cosmology/physics have more familiarity with their field because they do years of theoretical/experimental practice and gain experience. And I know they do not teach you philosophy in cosmology/physics, but you can learn philosophy independently by yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

This feels also true for political philosophy. Without knowing political science, sociology, or economics, your philosophical arguments will become superficial. I had a professor at my University whose expertise was on political freedom, but she had no real political knowledge about her own country. Again, I know those fields do not teach you philosophy, but I believe you can learn philosophy 

&amp;#x200B;

\-The second reason: the Academy seems to become worse, especially in philosophy. The job market is nearly non-existent, and hierarchy and freedom in the academy become worse and worse. I can self-study philosophy instead. Now, what is valid for studying sciences is probably valid for studying philosophy, meaning getting a philosophy PhD in a good university will probably teach you philosophy better than just self-studying philosophy.

99,"I was listening to a sermon when the preacher said that modern rules of war, specifically the Geneva Convetion, were strictly Christian in origin. They were derived from the works of St. Augustine. He said it seems like common sense that, in war, it is unjust to attack fleeing soldiers, to kill non-combatants, or to target civilian assets with no military or strategic value. However, he argued, it's not common sense -- it is Christian theology. The rules of war, he claimed, were developed by St. Augustine and based on Biblical principles.

This struck me as, not just odd, but outright wrong. Non-combatants are killed in the Bible all the time (the slaughter of the midianites (Numbers 31:1-18), the slaughter of the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15), for example). Fleeing soldiers are attacked from the rear (Joshua 10:19). Civillian assets are routinely targeted (Deuteronomy 13:16,Numbers 31:10, Judges 20:38, Judges 20:48). In fact, Saul is punished by God for showing mercy and declining to kill civilians. He is harshly chastised and loses his kingship!

In doing some cursory research on the topic, it seems that Augustine's philosophy on war in *City of God* is not so much based on the Bible, rather it seems rooted in Greek philosophy most notably the works of Cicero regarding ""right intention"".

Am I mistaken in thinking that modern rules of war have no Biblical basis and are not rooted in Christian thought, rather they seem to be more rooted in Western philosophy? Was the preacher correct?

104,"Ok, im going crazy about this so hopefully you guys can clarify for me this whole notion of physics ""not caring about a direction of time""

I know the laws of physics are time symmetric, in principle all processes can go forward or backward. I know the assymetry comes down to the second law of thermodynamics and how incredibly unlikely is to see some processes act in reverse (like a broken glass rearranging itself after the fact)

However i dont see how these factors mean time is an illusion. Causality is still a thing right?

I know there are some disputes about wether the block universe is a correct interpretation of reality (that basically the future is already defined), also our universe is very complex and there are still some shenanigans with the second law of thermodynamics that are fixed by brute force. So this is why i want to simplify this deal with the most basic conception of reality i can imagine and you can tell me if my intuitions are right.

Okay, so on this reality there is just a white canvas; there is no movement, no matter, no energy, nothing. It looks like a white canvas just because (for now let's ignore that there is an observer processing information or why there is color)

So if nothing is happening i would assume most modern phycisists would say time does not exist (Only Newton would argue the contrary) let's call this State 1. Just a white reality.

Boom! All of a sudden everything is black. Something has happened, so i assume this marks the point when time exists? Or causality? Let's call this State 2.

Here is where i feel semantics begins to appear and what physicists mean by time having no direction. And that basically you can say time exists or doesn't and it is the same thing: let's suppose that all of a sudden the canvas goes to white. Clearly our toy reality is ""time symmetric"" A physicist can analyze the situation and claim that the system ""went back"" to State 1. That the system travelled to the past. But other phycisist can chime in and say ""no, wait! The system continued traveling ""forward"" to State 3, it just happens that State 3 is the same as State 1. So time is real.

I guess one question is do any of these modes of talking about time has more advantages over the other? Intuitively, i feel that the time symmetric view loses information about what happened in reality. Also, does this show that having time symmetric laws does not entail us to say time is not real?

Another question i have is; am i right in saying that i cant possibly hope to say how much ""time"" passed between State 1 and State 2? Because in our model reality it is the only known process to ever happen. But time must have surely passed so maybe there is really absolute time as Newton said? Does this mean that we can only measure nature after a third state has taken place?

I guess im getting too crazy thinking about this stuff, so hopefully you can give me some insights. I really wanna know what is the deal with time.

107,"I'm taking a beginner ethics course, and one of the first things that we are going over is objective and non-objective morality. I'm pretty persuaded by a lot of the reasoning of non-objective moral systems, but I am sort of struggling to understand the position of people with non objective morality over how to understand how it works as a moral system with respect to society. The problem I run into goes like this: 

1) Non-objective morality argues that morality stems from evolutionary or natural reasons. The moral intuitions of humans come as a result of our biological desire to maintain ourselves as a species. (If this is not the case, I may be misunderstanding something more fundamental, but people seem to agree that this is the root of moral judgements if there is not an objective source e.g God.) 

2) Non-objective morality would make moral judgements based on the consensus and moral intuitions of human beings. Murdering someone is wrong because there are evolutionary reasons why we know it is wrong axiomatically. 

3) In the case of people without moral intuitions (psychopaths, sociopaths, etc.) then we rely on the consensus of society to make moral judgements. Even though that individual person may lack the capacity to morally reason, society understands that the actions of a sociopath are wrong, so they are wrong. 

(Obviously I am paraphrasing the argument a bit, but I think that's a decent summary) 

So then, my question is, how does objective morality condemn abhorrent moral judgements if the society in question does not view them as wrong, or there is a naturalistic/evolutionary reason for why they developed that way? For instance, many ancient cultures believed in ritual sacrifice, something we would obviously say is probably immoral. Suppose you were to time travel back to an ancient culture and have to explain why their practice was wrong. What could you say to an ancient person to get them to agree (assuming they are perfectly persuadable by logical argumentation) to get them to stop that practice? In a similar vein, the evolutionary status quo for an infectious disease would be to let it spread through the population and kill anyone without resistance, and the survivors have antibodies. If morality stems from evolution, why is it not correct to just let plagues run rampant and have the survivors be the ones who can resist it? Overall, if we assume morality is not objective, how do we make moral judgements when society or consensus would disagree with the ""actual"" moral truth (ex. we shouldn't kill people)?

I may be misunderstanding something about the subjectivist position, so if that is the case let me know.

125,"For example, the origin story of the Christian religions includes quite a few things we now know are not true. We all know what they are; the earth being created in 6 days, Noah's flood, humans being created fully formed as homo sapiens etc. In what I've read so far and from questions on this sub, it seems that philosophers disregard the content of religious texts and just focus on the core question: ""Does an all-powerful etc. God exist?"".

It seems to me that a better approach would be to examine the claims that each religion makes against the available evidence and rational thought. Work up to the bigger question by asking and answering a bunch of smaller questions. Such as: ""Was the entire universe, including all animals and mature homo sapiens created in 6 days?"" The answer to this is no, the evidence to date would strongly indicate that the universe took many billions of years to form the current state, and humans took many millions of years to evolve into our current form.

Now if we ask the question: ""Could a Three Os God both exist and have created our current universe in 6 days?"" The predominant answer would be: Yes they could exist but no they didn't create the universe in 6 days. I'm aware there are some more absurd answers like ""God could have done all that and also created the evidence for evolution etc."", but, you know ... 

Could a God have triggered the big bang and set the universe in motion? Well he could have, but an infinite variety of other things also could have done that. 

If we proceed in this manner and rule out all the claims from each religion that we already know are not true, what does that leave us with? I understand that this will probably not resolve the ""Is God Real?"" question in a binary way, but from a probability point of view, surely it would come out as highly improbable?

Where I'm at currently, it still seems like religions are very, very similar to conspiracy theories. I can't understand why the tools we use to disregard conspiracy theories can't be used to disregard a religious belief. I understand that many people have very deeply held beliefs that they build their life around. I also understand that the scope of the claims between conspiracies and religions are on completely different levels, but I still can‚Äôt see them as different things. Most successful conspiracy theories have a non-falsifiable core. For example, we still can‚Äôt prove definitively that there is no Sasquatch. Most people dismiss the existence of the Sasquatch because it is ridiculous and because there is zero evidence to support the claim. However, when pressed, Sasquatch believers will create a never ending list of reasons for why no one has been able to prove its existence. From a deductive logic point of view, we can‚Äôt say that Sasquatch doesn‚Äôt exist. The elephant in Carl Sagan‚Äôs garage is another good example, although this belief system doesn‚Äôt seem to have as many dedicated followers. 

Using Scientology as another example, I‚Äôm fairly sure there is strong evidence to suggest that their founder completely fabricated the religion. I would imagine that there is also strong evidence to suggest that their auditing techniques are not as effective as current psychological and medical treatment methods. Now we can‚Äôt say definitively that the God Xenu does not exist, but we can say that the vast majority of their origin story strongly indicates that it was falsified, which makes it very likely that their god does not exist. 

It seems that if we ask the question ‚ÄúCould the God Xenu exist and have done all the things claimed by Scientologists?‚Äù (nukes in volcanoes, flying around in DC-10 spaceships etc.) The answer would be: Yes he could hypothetically exist, but no he could not have done all those things. The same for Christianity ‚ÄúCould a three Os God both exist and have done all the things claimed by Christianity?‚Äù. The answer would be: Yes they also could hypothetically exist, but no they could not have done all those things. Therefore the likelihood that they actually exist is very low.

126,"I have this very old logic textbook that briefly takes on Kant in its section on the necessary vs. contingent relations of propositions. It says that Kant has too narrow a definition of synthetic judgement. As I've tried to understand Kant's thought over the years this particular passage has often haunted me. I'd really like to quote the two paragraphs in question.

*...The simple proposition '2 ans 3 are 5' contains a necessary relation between the subject '2 and 3' and the predicate '5.' No amount of analysis, though, will disclose the presence of '5' in the subject '2 and 3.' Nevertheless, this is not a synthetic, but an* analytic *judgment. Here the predicate is not contained in the comprehension of the subject, but an analysis will reveal the fact that the subject '2 and 3' is contained in the comprehension of the* predicate*. What is '5'? It is ""1+1+1+1+1.' What is '2'? It is '1+1.' And '3'? It is '1+1+1.' Therefore, the subject '2 and 3' is identical with '1+1 and 1+1+1,' and this is found in the predicate '5' which is '1+1+1+1+1.' The truth of the judgment is disclosed by an* analysis of the predicate *in its relation to the subject, and this makes the proposition analytic. This will always be the case when the predicate is a 'property' of the subject, since a 'property' does not belong to the definition of the subject and still results necessarily from the essence.*

*It is well to bear this in mind, since most modern philosophers, following the noted German philosopher Emmanuel* \[*sic*\] *Kant (1724-1804), define these two types of propositions differently. They define the* analytic *proposition as 'one in which the* predicate *is contained in the* definition of the subject'; *and the*  synthetic *proposition as 'one in which the* predicate *is* not *contained in the* definition of the subject.' *This definition is entirely* too limited. *According to this explanation, only those propositions can be styled analytic in which the predicate is found in the subject. This is an arbitrary restriction. Surely, any proposition whose* necessary truth *can be shown by a mere* analysis of the subject and predicate *should be called* analytic, *whether the predicate be contained in the subject or the subject in the predicate. The later has just as much right to be called an analytic proposition as the other. Now, as has just been shown, we* can *prove the necessary truth of propositions based on 'property' by an* analysis *of subject and predicate, since in this case the subject is contained in the comprehension of the predicate. Hence, these propositions are genuinely* analytic, *and are not 'synthetic a priori,' even though the predicate here is not contained in the definition of the subject. The attitude here of the Kantian philosophers is therefore incorrect and unwarranted.*

Since I still struggle with the more technical end of Kant's philosophy, I'd really appreciate it if anybody out there could show how Kant dealt with this fundamental problem. The argument quoted above seems plain to me, and yet Kant's ethics make sense also and they are founded on the very idea of a synthetic a priori judgment.

I majored in philosophy in undergrad, but only had a little bit of exposure to philosophy of the mind. To this day I can‚Äôt quite figure out what position I subscribe to among various dualist and monist theories‚Ä¶or if there is even is a cohesive theory out there that reflects my beliefs. I will try to explain below, based on my entry-level understanding of philosophy of the mind. Feel free to ask for clarification or point out any inconsistencies, conceptual misunderstandings, etc. that I make. 

I‚Äôve gathered that supporting Cartesian substance dualism is about as lame/erroneous as supporting Reganomics nowadays. Most philosophy of mind scholars I‚Äôve encountered are some form of monist. Yet I think I might be some kind of a dualist. 

On the one I hand, I don‚Äôt believe in substance dualism‚Äîto me, the ‚Äòmental‚Äô is not a substance the way the ‚Äòphysical‚Äô is. On the other hand, I flatly reject eliminative materialism, because I do believe that mental states *exist* in some sense. 

Yet I‚Äôm hesitant to fully embrace other property dualist and monist theories either. For me the problem is how these theories give primacy to the physical over the mental. My view is that the physical and the mental are equally ontologically valid. They are intertwined, to be sure, but I do not believe that the mental supervenes on the physical. 

In considering non-reductionist physicalism versus reductionist physicalism, I like how the former compared to the latter seems to give slightly less privilege to the physical over the mental. Rather than holding that all mental phenomena are reducible to physical phenomena, non-reductionist physicalism merely holds that the mental can be ‚Äòmapped on‚Äô to the physical. I want to phrase it a bit different though (in rejection of supervenience), and say that the mental and the physical are equally correlated to each other. 

But also, I wonder if perhaps my rejection of supervenience is irreconcilable with my rejection of substance dualism. From my novice viewpoint, I figure the mental can be just as ontologically valid as the physical without that meaning that the world is comprised of a mental substance and  a physical substance. I suppose it depends on what ‚Äòsubstance‚Äô really means. In my everyday understanding. I see the word ‚Äòsubstance‚Äô as tautological to the word ‚Äòphysical‚Äô‚Äîindicating the material world, made up of atoms/matter. But for substance dualists, the word ‚Äòsubstance‚Äô indicates something beyond the material world, something they thought was more first-order.

I‚Äôll add that Nietzschean Skepticism has a big influence on my philosophical world view. His criticism of enlightenment-era scientific hubris (that man can ascertain capital T-Truth through scientific study) remains relevant today. The academy still worships and yearns for objective certainty. Because mental phenomena cannot be pinned down with objective certainty, the category is overlooked and devalued.",Philosophy of Mind: is it possible to reject supervenience without being a substance dualist?,askphilosophy

For clarity, I'm referring to the Churchlands' type of E.M. about propositional attitudes, and not E.M. about qualia.

To organise my thoughts better, I've numbered them:

1. My first doubt is this one: is E.M. internally inconsistent? In the paper ""Eliminative Materialism and the propositional attitudes"", Paul Churchland argues that is not, and he compares this objection to defences of vitalism, but I'm unsure: the reason why vitalism was disproven is because everything about a person being alive can be explained by bodily processes, but if you deny that for holding a position you need to have it as a belief, then you also have to explain what that position actually is: if it's not a believe, because beliefs (defined as propositional attitudes) don't exist, then what is it? Something that hasn't been yet discovered?

2. Is E.M. unlikely to be 100% correct? What I mean is: modern science is complex, and a theory doesn't always get thrown in the trash just because something about it is wrong. So, if folk psychology is a theory, would the discovery that no ""language of thought"" exists be enough for it to throw it all away? After all, folk psychology seems to be effective, or at least passable at making predictions about behaviour.

3. I also have some doubts about the ""future predictions"" presented by Paul Churchland in his important paper, and the first one is if the first of the various alternatives in the future is actually Eliminative Materialism: in the first prediction, Churchland predicts that the propositional attitudes will be kept by most of the population, so I guess they're actually viable?

4. About the second prediction, my doubt is: wouldn't a future language such as the one that Churchland describes be at least similar to the old propositional attitudes' filled one? Churchland says it wouldn't, but I'm not sure I understand why.

5. The last one: does E.M. base itself a lot on connectivists' theories, or can it work without them? A lot of the stronger connectivism seems to have been absorbed by more complicated theories, so I'm not sure.

New to the Law of One. Very Fascinated by it. Downloaded the entire book online. The entire pdf file is nearly 953 pages and I intend to read every page of it. However, reading such a vast piece of text is time consuming but I will still do it.

# I am interested in learning telepathy, its practical applications by use of my own will. My basic intention, therefore, is to understand the mechanics of Non-Verbal Communication from the POV of an advanced being and to know whether a human can harness it. I haven‚Äôt read the book and what little I know is from YouTube videos. The information is highly controversial and murky among the community and that is why I skipped the audiobooks and went for the written text; can take my time to understand whatever I grasp.

So, when I used words like ‚Äò6th density beings‚Äô, ‚Äòsocial consciousness‚Äô, ‚ÄòRa‚Äô, etc. I mean that I have understood some concepts about the book via the media. And since this book deals with scientific experiments conducted to contact extra terrestrials (as stated in the first few pages of the book), I am intrigued to know the process. Since the idea of extra terrestrials has been presented as fiction to the normal population until now, this non-fiction book is a brave one to state outright the existence of UFOs, aliens, and higher beings (which I do believe in). I want to keep my expectation under control and hence seeking out help from people who have read and understood the books.

I have read Russel Targ‚Äôs book, the Intention Experiments and a few others where the application of one‚Äôs thoughts are discussed. I am keen on knowing the fundamentals and the practical means of applying them from a human point. 

# But before a deep dive in to reading the 5 volumes, I need to ask this ‚Äì

# 1. Is this book just a philosophical text that details the experience of a higher, 6 density social consciousness?

# 2. And are there any practical applications that a 3rd density (human beings) can use? 

# 3. There are mention of seances and other methods of meditation mentioned in the book; are they mentioned in detail?

# 4. Has anyone practically applied them and got connected to the higher beings? If so, then can you point me in the direction of the literature/ media.

# 5. Will be able to use the techniques to communicate telepathically with humans using the info from this book? Of course with practice!

Ethics as a useful practical science, akin to carpentry or medicine.

People want to be morally good and act in accordance with the moral law so knowledge of the moral facts and of their obligations is useful to help them achieve this end. But what about those who don't desire to be morally good or care if they act in accordance with the moral law or not? Isn't knowledge of the moral law and the moral facts completely useless for such people? Ethics can not serve its practical purpose if it's just a list of moral facts for such people.

I have a school discussion about the relationship between reflective equilibrium and ethics, and currently my take on it is that they are technically the same thing(?)

My question is where the line is drawn? Are these two topics one of the same or there is a clear defiance between the two? 

I think ethics is a more broad topic since it reflects on 'all humans' interactions and actions but reflective equilibrium is a very 'in-the-moment' thing or 'eye-opener', an instance where our ideas and beliefs are challenged to what we originally thought and our morals are conflicting against eachother.

188,"Hi !

Thank you in advance for reading my very long post, I just want to make sure I get to the essence of my question, since this is purely for my own enjoyment and I haven't had the chance to discuss my reading of the Manifesto with anyone. (Mostly because saying the C word &gt;!\[communism\]!&lt; automatically brands you as an Anarchist and a weirdo where I live). BTW, I am an absolute noob in Philosophy, I did some classes in college but that is it. Forgive my bad arguments and their redaction, I aspire to get better.

So I just finished The Communist Manifesto, and I am still confused on its moral origin. When I say ""building block"" or ""origin"", I mean the basic moral concepts and ideas, as well as any moral systems that Marx and Engels used to write the Communist Manifesto.

For some context, I did read a bit on the socioeconomic conditions in Europe of the early 19th century and the French Revolution to have a better understanding of the era in which the Manifesto was written. 

However, I still don‚Äôt understand what exactly were the values that Marx and Engels were basing their work on. I‚Äôm trying to reflect on this because of the following quote I read in an essay on the Communist Manifesto in [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/20/yanis-varoufakis-marx-crisis-communist-manifesto), by Yanis Varoufakis :

&gt;‚ÄúOn the topic of dystopia, the sceptical reader will perk up: what of the manifesto‚Äôs own complicity in legitimising authoritarian regimes and steeling the spirit of gulag guards? Instead of responding defensively, pointing out that no one blames Adam Smith for the excesses of Wall Street, or the New Testament for the Spanish Inquisition, we can speculate how the authors of the manifesto might have answered this charge. I believe that, with the benefit of hindsight, Marx and Engels would confess to an important error in their analysis: insufficient reflexivity.‚Äù

I understand that the author means that it is unfair to say that political/philosophical works are to be blamed for other crises or catastrophic events, and I agree with that idea. But it is like the author is being still being unfair to the works he cited. For instance, in The New Testament (I was raised catholic, but I am an atheist), I was always taught that the basic tenet, what Jesus preached, was Love :

&gt; John 15:12-13 : **12**¬†This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. **13**¬†Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one‚Äôs life for his friends. 

You can argue that the Roman Church degenerated into something else that Jesus preached, but I don't find it unreasonable to give the original authors of the New Testament the benefit of doubt. The Roman Church did go against the main tenets and virtues of the Bible, and used their privileged moral positions in Royal Courts throughout Europe. However, I would argue that the Manifesto criticism that Varoufakis is pointing out, is not unfair.

In the second part of the Manifesto, *Proletarians and Communists*, when the authors discuss the measures for ""\[...\] entirely revolutionizing the mode of production"", they call for :

&gt;1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Abolition of all right of inheritance.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.  
&gt;  
&gt;5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with  State capital and an exclusive monopoly.  
&gt;  
&gt;6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.  
&gt;  
&gt;7. Equal liability of all to labour. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.

I believe that these measures are tyrannical, in the sense that they force or coerce a part of the population into doing something against their own interests. I think I understand where these measures come from, and I would even agree with all of them (1 to 8) to an extent, but I can't help thinking that these measures are better enforced by an Autocratical regime, and that this could the authors' intention.

In other words, it seems to me that the Communist Manifesto is an invitation for charismatic individuals of any class to rally members of the proletariat against a clear enemy, one they can call the bourgeoisie, and bestow upon themselves the blessing of the communist cause. I would also argue that it is fair to point out that this is what ended up happening with the different communist revolutions during the Cold War, most notably in the Soviet Union. As a side note, I feel like even today, members of the Right wing of politics use populism to rally partisan troops behind them.

So again, I just wish to understand where exactly Marx and Engels where coming from in terms of their main values or tenets. I would like to see, in their mind, what was the average proletariat r√©volutionnaire supposed to be like in order to carry out the revolution. Where they actually hoping for people to be like Lenin or Stalin ? Or were they hoping for someone else ?

I know that this is a very long question, so please feel free to simply recommend other books or works to continue my journey. I have also been looking forward to read some of the same stuff that Marx and Engels were reading when they came up with the Manifesto.

200,"From someone knowing almost nothing about philosophy. I'm very ignorant on this subject. This is most probably just gibberish. 

Is philosophy about a lot of theories and arguments that cannot all be tested as true? And the tests have to come from scientific experiments? (Empirical evidences?)

Philosophy can certainly be false in nature but useful-- as good philosophy uses valid logic to come to some conclusions. Therefore it can be used to provide education on logical thinking and discourses. So I'm not debating whether philosophy is useful or not.

Some may claim that science is about how things work only, and philosophy is about the why. Or in fancier words,it is about the fundamental questions.

However, isn't it that we have to know about the world's workings(the hows) before knowing the whys? 

For example, I have to know the workings of the brain, before i know why consciousness exist. My reasoning/one possible way for that to happen is that, scientific evidences obtained by a scientific approach can be clues that lead up to follow-up investigations. By following clues and evidences, we will come to a better understanding of what we perceive. Hence there will be something out there uncovering the whys at last? 

This is like an investigation of crimes. We may not know the intentions and motives, but by following evidences gathered, the offender will be found, and we can understand the motives from there.


Philosophy on the other hand, is more like the speculations, or some logical brainstorming beforehand. The speculations can be useful for later investigations, but can be proven wrong.

One of the greatest empires the world has ever seen was the Great British Empire, the empire basically exploited, pillaged, and took by force or by intimidation what it wanted. It was deeply racist and based itself on slavery and the exploitation of the locals. I belong to a country that was under this rule and we have records of the workings of the empire in the local settings of our country. However, the Britishers behaved totally differently among themselves. They were ""just"" among themselves, and had the rule of law, a complex bureaucracy predicated on law and order, hierarchy, and justice. I think it's one of the major reasons they were so successful. They were unjust towards the people they exploited but just among themselves which led to their success as an empire among empires. A few of the reasons that contributed to the fall of this great empire were corruption, nepotism, and injustice among themselves.

What I understand from all this is that to create a stable, successful society there should be a sense of justice among its members.

Unless I am very confused about Mill, there's nothing else that is Good or Right which can't be reducible to those things in his theory.

So for the previous lecture, we had to read part of Plato‚Äôs Theaetetus. We focused on the question of what knowledge is, and in particular on the claim that knowledge is perception. Now, in Theaetetus, according to Socrates (in the dialogue), for this claim to be true the claim that man is the measure of all things and that everything is constantly in flux both have to be true. Our lecturer tried to explain why the claim that knowledge is perception entails that everything has to be in flux by giving an example of 2 different perceptions of a chair. If I perceive a chair as red and another perceives it as yellow, the ‚Äúmeasure doctrine‚Äù holds that both perceptions are the truth. But if both perceptions are true, then it must be true that the world is changing such that my perception of the red colour of the chair is true and another‚Äôs perception of the yellow colour of the chair is true.

221,"You can replace ""power"" here by ""resources"" or ""energy"" or a similar concept.

A middle class person in a developed country today has more comforts, food variety, healthcare, entertainment, safety, etc. than kings had 500 years ago. There are many reasons for this, but a major one is that in a democratic society (that is, one in which the majority of the population are not slaves / one where an oligarchy controls all resources), individuals can have a purposeful existence, gather resources themselves, start businesses, and so on. 

This then leads to the development of certain industries which would otherwise not exist. A slave has no rights and therefore very little motivation for creating an innovative new business, whereas an individual has a lot of motivation. Over time, this leads to advances in fields which then end up benefiting the powerful. The key point being that the powerful *would not* develop these innovations themselves, as they lack the energy, time, or desire to say, build a shipping company or a toilet company.

So, the conclusion is that inequality actually *limits* the power and quality-of-life of the most powerful. In other words, it's in their own selfish interest to distribute some power and resources, as it leads to the development of technologies and other innovations that benefit them.

229," Right now am working in Cioran and Internet Suicides, here is an advance of the argumentation I want to develop. I hope you can give me feedback, the text was translated really fast, so if there are flaws don't take them into count.

**Of internet suicides and saints**

The idea of suicide in Cioran serves as an interpretive mean for understanding suicide in digital spaces

**The hermeneutics of tears:**

Cioran's work is born from the desolation and abjection provided by the experience that can only be summed up as finding oneself on the peaks of despair. From the hermeneutics of tears, which is the interpretation of the phenomenological features of despair, it is possible for Cioran ""to understand the peaks of history and dispense with the ¬´events¬ª (...) to rise above oneself "" (Cioran, p.23, 1937). It is in the internalization of fear, obsession, and pain where the necessary lucidity is acquired to reconfigure the way in which we experience the world, this new way of interpreting the world leads us to the rejection of the absolute and the glimpse of the emptiness of me and god

In the void, the ordinary temporary experience that is a mere illusion ends, it also culminates with the longing for the lost paradise and the meaning of the actions. This experience of emptiness is achieved through the ecstasy that is the result of absolute exhaustion, this boredom is typical of enduring life as it manifests as illness and anguish. In Cioran's words "" we understand death as an excess of life"". (1936, p.254) This inner place of complete emptiness is reached through defeat, the realization of one's worthlessness, and empty victories. The longing for the lost paradise refers to an idyllic state, where life did not arouse any concern, where knowledge remained forbidden and foreign (Cioran, 1940). From the beginning of the temporary experience, fear was fuel for the construction of the illusion whose purpose is to deceive man of existence, the illusion distances us from the absoluteness of the void and its expansion; establishes the delusion of the absolute. The illusion becomes knowledge in the sense of linguistic constructs that are the basis of alienation.

It is through wakefulness and insomnia that the necessary lucidity is acquired to conceive life outside the illusion of salvation, this conception is only possible in the face of the experience of one's own emptiness that refers to the emptiness of the world.

In cases like that of the saints, especially the martyrs who by default have for Cioran, an obsession with sin established and in the face of this obsession the understanding of life as condemnation and pain, suffering, a preparation for death is developed. In the irrational illusion where salvation from deception is experienced, the martyr loses his fear of death because of the boredom caused by his obsession with it. The saint's obsession with life easily becomes an obsession with sin and in turn in the recognition of his own sin, thus the martyr develops a thought against himself and in favor of the world. He understands that his death through self-sacrifice is a means of deliverance from sin.

In this way, pain and illness become inexhaustible sources that feed a void that trains the person in the experience of non-being and thus the fear of death falls into the meaninglessness of the totality due to boredom. That person who learns to live in fear discovers his inability to be-in and in the face of this, fear operates parallel to his existence. ‚ÄúWhoever has overcome the fear of dying has also triumphed over life, which is nothing more than the other name of that fear.‚Äù (1937, p.6) This victory is only possible in the face of boredom with life, it is similar to the perspective of the patient who is more afraid of the idea of continuing to be than of ceasing to be. Only illness is capable of offering the lucidity necessary to break the illusion that life plays in matter.

**The weariness and the emptiness in God:**

‚ÄúIn full boredom, we slide towards the lowest point of the soul and of space, towards the antipodes of ecstasy, towards the roots of the Void.‚Äù (p.124, 1952) The weariness of life leads to the obsession with death, which implies the constant ideation of one's own, it is important to point out that, for illness, pain and death, there is no weariness, these experiences by the emptiness they offer is inexhaustible, there is no limit to the patient's deterioration, their decline does not imply conflict, it is a fluid progress that culminates and continues in the death of the body. This is the problem of the meaninglessness of health and action, all effort is reduced to nothing, no matter how hard some struggle to cling to life, all die. Such an effort is nothing more than a waste, life as a good is an illusion, life is a perishable good, the human being is a being who has no other destiny than non-being. This allows us to conclude that the life of the being is a deception product of knowledge as self-awareness, the fear of death in this sense part of its enigmatic and inexhaustible character. A consciousness that thinks itself perceives its loneliness and isolation, but fails to consider itself identical, its destiny in terms of ceasing to be is inconceivable from its being. The illusion of identity is constantly threatened by its rupture and fear is nothing more than a constant.

Life as fear leads to unresolvable conflict which inevitably ends in ecstatic exhaustion leading ultimately to God. The martyr does not implore for the end of his pain, but uses his pain as a means to death. He seeks God not as a subterfuge for his salvation, the protection of his life, but to lead him to death. Eternity directly evokes the image of death itself, it links God's emptiness with ours. Our emptiness is the reality of our condition of non-being and the emptiness of God is the immensity in which we are nothing. In my experience I can add that those people who fear death tend to fear life and those who self-destruct fear themselves.

The experience of inner emptiness is only possible under the torments that precede ecstasy. It is the limited experience that refers to the image of torment and exhaustion in which we can contemplate our own emptiness (the meaninglessness of all action) and in turn, the emptiness in God (The immensity in which everything loses its being), ""the union between human solitude and the infinite desert of God becomes inexpressible delight"" (1937, p.16), sublime suffering that awakens man from his illusion of being and leads him little by little to non-man, the absolutely abject, the person who directs his tantalizing impulses against himself.

For Cioran, interest in God stems from this process of fear, boredom and obsession that culminates in the ecstasy of tears that is symptomatology of the soul, since only in the limits of the body as matter can the soul lose consciousness of the illusion in which exists. ‚ÄúWe find God in sin, god on the way to the heights of despair: The more we care about God, the more we lose our innocence. In paradise, no one cared about him. It was the fall, and only the fall, that caused this strange curiosity.‚Äù (1937, p.18)

Time begins in the fall, Cioran understands humanity as exiled from paradise, eternally yearning and condemned to exist in a vacuum, alienated and alone. ‚ÄúBetween Weariness and Ecstasy, our entire experience of time unfolds‚Äù (p.44, 1952) where becoming is agony, an outcome that finds its home within obsession where tedium itself becomes the substance of emptiness, Exhaustion stems from incapacity and the gradual loss of the meaning of all action. Existence leads to the void, to the fall, to the corpse, to the abject. Only in the alienation of the abjection of being that is in itself: non-being, is the end of temporal experience as possible, suffering becomes immeasurable and puts an end to the anguish that sustains our being in the world. Suffering belies this stay and leads to the end, to pause, to the idea of death. In this way, the temporary experience is a solitary encounter that continually throws us into ‚Äúa nothing that grows, a void in full expansion, similar to a threat from beyond. In the silence of contemplation (...) the advance of time within itself as the advance of death‚Äù (p.148, 1934). The non-being, lies in wait for everything that is, it is not hasty to suppose in the face of the experience of the void that only the non-being can be sustained as constant, the void as the only reality.

**Thought against itself as a response to the boredom of the world:**

Cioran's proposal to resignify the world is thought against itself, only surrendering ourselves to emptiness and nonsense allows us to put an end to the illusion. To think against oneself is to scheme in favor of emptiness, to eliminate the self and all consciousness of identity with the matter. This delivery allows complete detachment, submerges us in the void and denies life, denies the self of its existence, the man of his progress and the history of his victories. Thus he builds the myth of failure, returns all progress to nothing, completely eliminates reason. It is a surrender to irrationality, rejects salvation and takes the path that leads to despair.

Salvation is finally empty, every social construct or memory is part of a decay designed by those who named things, all part of the substantiation of the world, the origin of knowledge that culminates in the fall, exile and loneliness, nonsense of language and yearns for primitive ignorance. Science is proof of our absolute incapacity as animals, due to our weakness we resort to external tools, our body alone, unlike other animals, is not capable of surviving without technology. History is the root of our forgetting, annihilates, like the emptiness of time, all action, all memory, feeds illusions, and builds false victories. The tedium generated by the apogee of progress, and the boredom of great civilizations naturally leads to decadence, to curiosity about pain, to internal impulses that respond to the reality of our non-being, self-destruction is the conclusion that comes from thought against itself. Self-hatred appears as a response to the rupture with the illusion of identity, self-destruction allows movement, and the change that leads being to stop being, constantly allows us to be another.

""You don't abdicate overnight: you need a carefully nurtured atmosphere of retreat, a legend of defeat."" (p.13, 1956) Like Rome, all civilization is driven through its greatness to boredom and the decline that they themselves cause in the face of boredom. The legend of defeat is built through internal conflict and division, born of mistrust, of expatriate parties that do not respond to identity, it is a war that is fought without fear in order to be another, non-being. Through the lucidity that comes from insomnia, in the ecstasy of the martyr, in the absolute experience of pain, ‚Äú a destructive energy is born (...) acid exaltation, the euphoria of annihilation! Surrendering to him, they hope, without a doubt, to be cured of that disease that is conscience. ‚Äù (p.16, 1956) The consciousness that comes from this experience bypasses the individual in such a way that only the idea of non-being is sustained. Facing the void we remain abject.

Thought against itself is a direct attack against time and life, it calls for complete immobility, the secession of all action, all thought. Here the individual ‚Äú is already tired of being himself, of walking in the uncertain, of wandering through the truths. Put the chains of Illusion on me, he sighs, as he bids farewell to the pilgrimages of Knowledge. ‚Äù (p.12, 1956) Thought against itself starts from the need for a change, from a force that leads to death or rebirth, if identity is experienced, it is a human impulse to abject it and return it to its diversity. It is this abjection that denies all identity that allows one to experience such a profound hatred for oneself that it inescapably leads to the only sustainable truth: non-being.

In this journey, man is transfigured, rejects the absolute, lose fear of time, and reconfigures himself as a non-man. ‚Äú Consciousness, temporary phenomenon if any, is pushed by it to its breaking point and falls to pieces with it. When destroyed, it will rise to its essence and fulfill its mission: to become its own enemy. If life has falsified matter, he has falsified life. ‚Äù (p.75, 1956) The non-man lives in a limited experience of existence, in which pain and fear end up sinking him out of time, below life and death. ‚Äú The maximum detachment that we can claim is to maintain ourselves in a position equidistant between revenge and forgiveness, in the midst of sullenness and generosity that are equally soft and empty, destined to neutralize each other. ‚Äù (p.33, 1960) All meaning is reduced to a complete banality in which fear does not seem to dominate the individual. It is in the emptiness of meaning where freedom manifests itself, in turn, what is the use of being free without meaning?

**Of internet suicides:**

Cioran introduces us to a philosophy born of depression, obsession, and insomnia. Here the term philosophy seems not very successful, perhaps more than a philosophy Cioran presents us with the roots of philophobia. But if we understand philosophy as the thought of an individual, we will find that Cioran offers not only a pessimistic and unstructured cynicism but a theory that seeks to encompass the experience of ecstasy under the framework of pain and despair. Cioran's pessimism is not an ethical guide, nor a metaphysics of reality, but a detailed phenomenology of his own experiences, which becomes an interpretive system of what I consider to be the experience of abjection, the encounter with non-being. and the outcomes it causes. To deepen this experience, it is necessary to delve into those manifestations that confirm the self-destructive impulses coming from civilization in decline.

It's hard to explain how spaces like Tumblr started a phenomenon that in my experience can only be defined as a suicide cult. On the internet, both blogs and forums, groups dedicated to specific topics emerged easily. I mention Tumblr for being a space where there was no type of filter in the content and at the same time an aesthetic approach focused on photos, poems and short texts. On Tumblr blogs, nurses shared their obsession with death. Here the narratives of pain overflowed, the images constantly referred to the fragility of the body, to blood, vomiting, fear, and violence. In that space, I discovered that loneliness and inner emptiness refer to a total emptiness that is shared. It is surprising to discover thousands of isolated, abject. Immersed in linguistic and symbolic themes, which are usually only assigned to silence or to the consulting room. If life is anguish and illness, the illusion that life manifests over matter is security, health, and progress. Few are the spaces in which it is allowed to live in disease, few are the spaces in which we can share the phenomenological experience of the pathology that living implies.

For this reason, I resort to forums on depression, illness, and suicide, these spaces are a clear source of obsession with salvation/sin/death, pain, boredom, experiences of emptiness and endless narratives that lead to abjection through thought against himself. These narratives are also developed under the same conditions of isolation and solitude that allow the complete dissolution of the illusion that life exerts on matter. I believe Cioran has the necessary conceptual keys to be able to understand the symptoms of a collective illness that seems to come from a non-sense that puts into play any idea of progress and any conception of health. What can be health or happiness for the abject that exist annihilating themselves, those people who cannot return to the illusion and for this reason live in longing for the original ignorance. I consider that the conditions in which we exist encourage a greater study of thought against itself as soon as its presence advances like the void to which everything refers here inside the kenoma , the phenomenal world that is agony and disease ( *agnoia* and *pathos* ).

Finally, it is important to point out the dangers that Cioran and suicide forums bring, not all people are in a position to assimilate nonsense and embrace pain. I do not think that self-destructive behaviors can be promoted by acceptance and understanding, these mechanisms only validate them as a reality but do not incite them, what incites abjection is mistreatment, agony, suffering, illness, and loneliness. Only those who have the predisposition of a patient accustomed to his illness are capable of returning from the heights of despair to care for all those who have just returned. These spaces are born from the need to share that those initiated in the gnosis of suffering have, people who no longer yearn for the lost paradise, people who live to share their desert. The non-man is one who has passed through countless dizzying nights, countless punishments of his own design, one who has pursued in anguish every illusion to constantly meet the void. If this non-man can do something, it is to live his non-being and to maintain this abject existence, I consider the possibility of this existence to be in freedom, understanding, and communion necessary. Nobody could predict that at some point in history people would come together to enjoy the idea of their own death.

**Comments:**

To carry out this proposal, it is necessary to delimit a specific subforum and resort to the works referring to the abjection of being by Julia Kristeva , since a hermeneutic approach to the productions of these people would allow a deeper understanding of the idea of suicide today. . The question that guides this research is: In what way is the idea of suicide present in the lives of people who produce and consume dedicated to this idea? Also developing this interpretation within Gnostic metaphysics (Valentinian, specifically its Eastern interpretation) allows a greater understanding of the deception that life exerts on the matter.

Regarding Reddit, this forum was one of the spaces where Tumblr users (100 million monthly) migrated after the reforms and the ban on NSFW content (2018).

Regarding counterarguments, there are endless studies that strongly conclude that these spaces promote self-destructive behavior and have a negative effect on society.

I don't understand how it is not self-evident and obvious that for humans to gain knowledge they need firstly as the basis sense data/information - experience - and secondly the cognitive functions that make sense of this information. To say that one or the other is the basis of knowledge is unequivocally false.

I visited the Wikipedia website on 'Rationalism'; consider the following passage

"" In an old controversy, rationalism was opposed to empiricism, where the rationalists believed that reality has an intrinsically logical structure. Because of this, the rationalists argued that certain truths exist and that the intellect can directly grasp these truths. That is to say, rationalists asserted that certain rational principles exist in logic, mathematics, ethics, and metaphysics that are so fundamentally true that denying them causes one to fall into contradiction. The rationalists had such a high confidence in reason that empirical proof and physical evidence were regarded as unnecessary to ascertain certain truths ‚Äì in other words, ""there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience"". ""

Let's focus on this: in other words, ""there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience"".

Even if it is mentioning in the paragraph that this is how the early rationalists thought about the topic, it is worth discussing it. I have a question in particular, how is any concept and knowledge gained 'independently' of sense experience?

Let's see a bit the intuition/deduction thesis

""Some propositions in a particular subject area, S, are knowable by us by intuition alone; still others are knowable by being deduced from intuited propositions.""

Next it has an example

""For example, when we combine both concepts, we can intuit that the number three is prime and that it is greater than two. We then deduce from this knowledge that there is a prime number greater than two. Thus, it can be said that intuition and deduction combined to provide us with a priori knowledge ‚Äì we gained this knowledge independently of sense experience ""

I am asking henceforth, how did you learn that number three is prime and that it's greater than two? Did you maybe learn it from your teacher, or your father or any individual or in an old papyrus, using your... sense organs getting sense experience? The problem I see here is that it uses the phrase 'independently of sense experience' when this is obviously false.

The point is that you can't gain knowledge by one or the other; you need both.

""Life is precious and consciousness are rare in this universe, therefore we should not go extinct, even though individual suffering that we will never truly prevent also exist, so we have no choice but to push forward despite nobody asking to be born and suffer from pure random bad luck. Basically the value of life and consciousness outweigh the suffering of individuals."" 

I find this argument weak and justifying the suffering of people for an abstract value that not all subscribe to, especially the victims of suffering that would rather be not subjected to their fate. 

I have yet to find a good argument that could thoroughly satisfy the victim's perspective and make it ok for them to suffer while others get to live the ""good"" life.

The reason why we know that is wrong to murder another person, take for instance Smith, Smith knows that it would be wrong to murder another human being because Smith was raised a catholic Christian. If Smith was asked how he knows that it is wrong to murder another human being, he would say that he knows it is wrong because it is the Seventh Commandment. He would finally say that it is God's Law.   


But we know that not everyone believes in God, let alone the Christian God. Jones on the other hand is an atheist, and he does not need God's law or the Ten Commandments to let him know that it is wrong to murder another man. It might be suggested that Jones is guided by his conscience, and a very generous helping of common sense.

1. Smith was raised a Christian Catholic and Jones was not raised a Christian Catholic and is an atheist. 
2. Smith knows the Ten Commandments. Jones is familiar with the Ten Commandments, but the Ten Commandments do not guide Jones in knowing that murder is wrong. 
3. Because Smith knows the Ten Commandments he also knows that it is wrong to murder another man. Jones knows it is wrong to murder another man, but this is not because he follows the Ten Commandments.

3,"Hi folks, 

I‚Äôm new to studying theology/philosophy, and I recently read Sushanta Sen‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Vedic-Upanisadic Concept of Brahman (The Highest God).‚Äù 

I‚Äôll outline some of Sen‚Äôs arguments with some of the counter-thoughts that I was having:

‚Ä¢Sen: ‚ÄúThe fact that one never loses one‚Äôs self-identity to oneself proves that somewhere within this ceaseless phantasmogaria there exists an abiding reality which simply witnesses these changes but does not become affected by them.‚Äù

Yet, there are plenty of people who struggle with self-identity and lose their identities to themselves. 

‚Ä¢Sen: The Self is ‚Äúunder a spell of cosmic nescience and forgets its real nature and wrongly identifies itself with the changing phenomena of the body and mind.‚Äù

If the Self is an unchanging and fixed substance, how could it forget? To forget is to experience change. 

‚Ä¢Sen: ‚ÄúThe fact that each conscious individual instinctively desires to escape suffering and resist death proves that this miserable and wretched existence is neither one‚Äôs essential nature nor final destiny.‚Äù

Then, he states that ‚Äúevery person wants to get rid of the sorrows and sufferings of human life.‚Äù However, regarding the former argument, if there are people who are masochistic or enjoy pain, (and thus, their bodies welcome it), this would seemingly dispute what he‚Äôs arguing. And there are people who are suicidal and/or desire death. As for the latter argument, there are plenty of people who don‚Äôt have the best intentions and those who don‚Äôt care about the lives of others. 

Anyway, I was curious if there were any articles that address these kinds of counter-arguments. I‚Äôm interested in developing a more nuanced perspective and learning more!

I'm really not sure where to start, so please redirect me if there is a better sub to ask this. I keep coming across a variety of works and ideas that I'm not exactly sure how to categorize.

Many years ago, I had a conversation about epistemology, I leaned towards empiricism at that time,  I investigated other schools of thought until it dawned on me that everyone used logic or reasoning to make their case. For example, under empiricism If one employs the scientific method, they will use reason to formulate a hypothesis, construct an experiment, and evaluate the result. So, an empiricist will, in fact must, appeal to logic/reason to obtain knowledge. And this is true for any other school of thought ‚Äì everyone will appeal to reason to defend their view as well as criticize/evaluate other views

Possible pushback: Rationalism begs the question - the rationalist will use a rational argument as a premise for the conclusion of his argument. To this I say no, it is testing a hypothesis. Test all epistemic theories, keep the best. 

I‚Äôll define Reason as analyzing and/or evaluating information gathered from various sources as a guide to convictions and action.

28,"I‚Äôm currently at university studying modern history. Throughout my studies I 
encountered the study of historiography (the study of how history has been interpreted, the role of an historians context, questioning the possibility and existence of historical truth).
I began to use the works of Edward Hallett Carr, Hayden White, Carl Becker, Keith Jenkins, Foucault &amp; Nietzsche.
I‚Äôve looked over Hegel, idealism and dialectics too. 

I find that my assignments and projects tend to lead down a path of post modernism and relativism, to eventual existentialism. 

This has started to become quite troublesome. I cannot get myself to complete an assignment. I get so lost in the research process and spiral from the implications/essence of post modernism and relativism, to an extent of existentialism. I feel like I cannot prove any historical argument or even decide what to argue. Everything feel contradictory and I cannot seem to ‚Äòside‚Äô with a particular historical school of thought. 

If none of the perspectives and sources I study can provide an historical truth, then what am I to research, what am I to argue, what am I meant to discuss? None of it is right or wrong and all the arguments and historical perspectives feel meaningless. If I do write an essay, it arguably has no meaning or objective truth and thus void. Being hyper aware of that has placed me into this state of academic paralysis. 

I feel so bound and ‚Äòtrapped‚Äô to this mode of thinking, I can‚Äôt seem to distance myself from it. Previous attempts were eventually hijacked by these modes of thinking. I cant seem to view history as history anymore, but only as a vast existential dilemma. Where the past has so many conflicting interpretations of the human experience its meaning that is undeniably relative. And therefore, we cannot find an objective or ‚Äòtrue‚Äô meaning. It becomes meaningless. 

This has started to fold into my own cognition and thoughts about the world, my life, language, social conventions and societal structures. 
I feel so stuck by this. I constantly feel lost, plagued by doubt and uncertainty. My studies and mental health are suffering immensely because of this dilemma. It has taken over my life and has sent me into a nervous breakdown. 

How can I ever view anything as true, objective, make a decision confidently or evaluate the value of something?

If I perceive a chair as red and another perceives it as yellow, the ‚Äúmeasure doctrine‚Äù holds that both perceptions are the truth. But if both perceptions are true, then it must be true that the world is changing such that my perception of the red colour of the chair is true and another‚Äôs perception of the yellow colour of the chair is true.

36,"I have recently read the first volume of Foucault¬¥  s History of Sexuality. From what I understood, he doesn't exactly say that sexuality is not repressed, but rather that repression should not be the one paradigm to understand the history of sexuality, and that, therefore, liberation of sexual practices should not be considered the end goal of the political trajectory of, for example, gay and lesbian movements.

His whole argument blew my mind in ways I did not expect. More specifically, I wondered what could be said, through this analysis, of sexual practices that are considered taboo, both inside and outside queer sexuality, since they pose grave ethical concerns. I am thinking, for example, of pederasty; of fringe practices such as the deliberate transmission of HIV (""poz""); or of the fetishisation of racialized people. If one understands sexuality within the boundary of repression and liberation, I cannot see why certain practices (e.g. sodomy) should be deemed ""worthy"" of liberation while others shouldn't. Or the other way around: the practice of exclusion of certain sexual acts within the scope of movements for queer liberation seems to be done quite arbitrarily, based on which sexual acts can be normatively assimilated into society and which cannot.

Foucault's genealogy of sexuality helps us trace the origin of sexual practices, both ethical and unethical, and does not see liberation as the actual end goal of sexuality. Does this understanding helps us in overcoming the issue stated above, i.e. how can we understand, and relate to an instance of liberation from sexual practices that are just bad?

61,"I want to talk about my journey and thoughts regarding my beliefs and spirituality. It will be a long post so thanks in advance for reading and commenting. 

I must say that I do believe in God still and Jesus, but I‚Äôm not sure how accurate the Bible is. It could have been influenced by people and those that chose what to include and exclude in the Bible. There could also be missing pieces as well. 

I want to first start off by saying that I grew up with a Christian family and pretty much everyone that I have known is a Christian with a few exceptions of people that I‚Äôve worked with and other people I have met out in the world. Recently I have been starting to question things and the accuracy of the Bible. I‚Äôm gonna make a few points below to kind of expand on all of this.

1.	Sin. I‚Äôm not sure I believe that sin exists. To me it seems like people wrote the Bible and chose what would be in the Bible. I do believe a lot of things that‚Äôs considered sinful is bad. It seems to be more about control though. That‚Äôs my opinion. I‚Äôve been researching a lot. My mind has been wondering and been curious a lot recently. One other thing I‚Äôm confused and conflicted about is why God would create people if he knew they would sin. Why not just remove sin completely? I mean I understand that God gave us Jesus. However it‚Äôs God so he could just get rid of sin and when Adam and Eve did what they did God could just forgive them anyways. To me this just doesn‚Äôt make sense why he didn‚Äôt just do this. 
2.	The Bible. From my understanding the Bible is a book of stories. With multiple authors. There has been things that people decide what is to be included and excluded from the Bible. Wasn‚Äôt the Bible written by people and what they were experiencing during that time or through stories passed down? How do we even know that the translations are correct? How do we know that the Bible wasn‚Äôt influenced or tampered with by people and that those people didn‚Äôt put things in the Bible or exclude things in the Bible to control others? Some people may argue that God would not allow these things to be in the Bible or the Bible to be tampered with, but if God gave people free will and he does not interfere in that free will couldn‚Äôt people who wrote the Bible and decided what was to be included or excluded have put what they want in the Bible since it‚Äôs part of their free will to do so?
3.	Shame. There are many things that I think kind of makes people feel shame. I know in the Bible it talks about a lot of different things and how you shouldn‚Äôt do this and you shouldn‚Äôt do that. Again I do believe that a lot of the things in the Bible that are considered to be a sin are bad things. There are also some things though that kind of conflict with others. If God loves us, which I believe he does, then why does he make us feel shame by including things in the Bible that causes us to feel that shame? 
4.	Being tied into a traditional religion. So while I do still believe in God and Jesus, I don‚Äôt really like being tied to a specific religion. I feel as though people believe what they believe. Can you even still believe in Jesus and God and even the Bible but not be considered a Christian or not associate with a specific religion or have a specific religion? Can‚Äôt you just believe what you believe?
5.	The last thing I want to kind of talk about is that I do still believe in God and Jesus, but I am kind of skeptical on how accurate the Bible is due to the fact that it could‚Äôve been influenced or change by people. That people could and probably did decide what was to be included and excluded in the Bible, and the fact that the translations may not be completely correct or that there may be missing pieces to the Bible.

I am still very much trying to decide what I believe and figure out myself and my life. I don‚Äôt mean to discredit anything in the Bible or God or anyone else‚Äôs beliefs. I‚Äôm just sharing this to hopefully get some insight and get some comments and things from other people who may be going through a similar experience or have gone through something like this in the past. I believe it is actually something probably everyone goes through in their life wondering and thinking and questioning these kinds of things.",Is it normal for a Christian to start to question things and be curious about things?,askphilosophy

He admits openly that he doesn't love her, he only likes her body, he does not care that he cannot have a meaningful conversation with her and that she doesn't share any of his intellectual interests.

74,"Many ethical theories are based on some type of hedonism, for example Epicureanism or utilitarianism. We organize much of our ethics around maximizing pleasure, or in other terms, ""happiness"". 

What is the ""essence"" of this pleasure? What is the current state of research in this area? 

I refuse to believe that ""pleasure"" is localized in only human brains. Human brains desire, but human brains are biological organs with chemical and physical basis. In short, I am a materialist. I believe in panpsychism, so I think that consciousness is not restricted to the human brain, but it is a quality of all phenomena. 

Take Schopenhauer's will for instance, we can detect the will as the Kantian ""thing-in-itself"" because we are aware of the will itself in our own conscious experience. But we are just biological organisms, composed of complex physical and chemical processes. The physical and chemical processes are also part of the will, because the will is omnipresent and characteristic of all phenomena. Just like panpsychism proposes a mind-like state ubiquitous to all things. 

There is research into pleasure hotspots in the human brain. From Wikipedia: 

&gt; As of October 2017, hedonic hotspots have been identified in subcompartments within the nucleus accumbens shell, ventral pallidum, parabrachial nucleus, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and insular cortex. 

But I do not think it is confined only to this. I do not think the phenomenon of pleasure itself is dependent on neurochemical molecules like dopamine or serotonin, or their effects. 

Can pleasure be a property of all things? Might it be comparable to thermodynamics, where an increase in pleasure is the conscious equivalent of a loss in heat? Pain receptors enable us the conscious experience of pain, is this an increase in energy which causes pain? All systems want to reach the lowest energy level, could this be the same as the processes in our brain? I only see this as an implication if panpsychism is true.","What is the ""essence"" of pleasure?",askphilosophy
75,"Recently I have read some Ivan Illich and also some anti- tech, anti-civilization thinkers like Jacque Ellul and even Ted Kaczynski aka the unabomber. I have also seen a rise in both previously left and right activists, writers and philosophers such as Paul Kingsnorth, Nina Power and Mary Harrington take this kind of anti-progress anti-technology stance and in the case of Paul Kingsnorth and Nina Power this extends to a sort revival of the christian faith.

So I do find some of these ideas attactive especially in the way that ideas of ""progress"" and growth are linked to debt and being able to service government borrowing and the impact of all this growth on the planet not to mention how unsustainable it all is interms of the resources available to us. So the idea of slowing down progress, reducing our reliance on technology and institutions, and making what we do decide to keep more sustainable sounds good. I also like Illich's emphasis on the importance of meaningful work and connections in life as well as his idea of conviviality, something that seems in short supply these days. I even see the appeal of the revival of faith and especially catholicism and christian orthodoxy as a way to de-centre man and his desires and the idea that if we can do it then why not. This all begins to fall into ideas of their being a ""natural order"" of things, that old conventions existed for a reason and that we'd do well to listen to the wisdom of these old ways. 

My discomfort with these ideas comes where this meets ideas of womens liberation. Yes technology shaped women's liberation through the invention of contraception. Women now go to university, get phd's, decide not to marry, not to have children, enter the workforce, don't have to stay home to look after their children and so on and these changes have had knock on effects in wider society which aren't always positive. Nina Power who is an unmarried and childless women herself by choice as well as a writer with a phd in philosophy says women should be encouraged to have children (young) and that women like her who don't and pursue and academic life etc should be rare. My question is how does she know this? How does she know what most women want? It isn't that long ago that women didn't have a lot of choice in becoming mothers, wives, working etc and we know from what women in these generations told us that they were not always happy and fufilled.

These ideas of anti-progress alway seem to lead to the idea that women should go back to the home and nursery and that both men and women should find beauty in their traditional roles as dictated by nature but my feeling is that this would be a cruelty to women. I can see the harmony in that idea as an aesthetic viewed from on high but the reality sees many people dictated to by nature rather than the technological society. It just doesn't square for me even if I kind of see the appeal.","Troubling issues with anti-progress, anti-tech philosophy?",askphilosophy

I can't really find any holes in this (this is a completely secular version of the Wager with any deity removed in case it wasn't clear.)

80,"I don't know know if this will come across as understandable or make sense but it's the opposite of this: I think it's pretty well known that often when someone is depressed and thinks how useless life what's the point of it all and similar negative thougts, it's often because the person is kind projecting the negative personal experience they are having on life in general. Meaning that once they find an activity or anyhting else that they like in their life even just getting back to work if they lost it  at that point they suddenly realize that was the problem all along an their whole outlook changes completely and the negative questions they were having its' not that they are rally asnwered but suddnely they seems pointless.  

I mean it's even how anti depressant medeicines work right?  If you're depressed and wonder whats the point of it all etc.. if you take them it's not like your questions are answered, you simply start expericing things in a differnet way and those questions on't seem so pressing anymore. 

So in a sense couldn't the opposte of this be that researchers obviously are happy with what they're doing and that is what living life is for them, THat's what they do, so in a way couldn't they forget not by malice but because that's inevitable  how weird living life is?

81,"I study computer science and I‚Äôm interested in properties that emerge from complex systems in the form of abstractions or other concepts which we can approximate with relatively simple heuristics.

One such system is the human mind. Among young people (such as myself) with no further studies in any of the relevant fields, it is believed that free will is an obvious property of the human mind. We believe we have the ability to make a choice and that choice is not simply an output of a physical system with many inputs. 

My question is (if my premise is right) how can the free will property be compatible with the causal model of reality? Processes seem to follow specific rules and evolve accordingly and there isn‚Äôt space for any mysterious interaction to change the course. 

This is really troubling me as it would entail that no ‚Äúself‚Äù is responsible for their actions and everything is evolving in sort of a deterministic manner.

I ask because while it's true that there are joys associated with romantic love, both casual and more committed kinds, it's also true that the pains associated with it quite often (more than we're sometimes willing to admit?) outweigh those joys, and quite significantly so. And given that that is the case, I've come to wonder whether the desire to seek romantic love is very prudent. 

Of course, this question has come from personal experience. I've been in two long-term, cohabiting relationships -- one I left, the other left me -- and one episode of unrequited love.

P1) If Socrates is a man, Socrates is mortal.

This initially seems like a watertight argument, but there is an implicit rule of inference that may not hold. Thus, the premises may all be true while the conclusion is false.

We may be able to solve this by making the modus ponens inference explicit.

P2) Socrates is a man.

P3) ((P  **‚Üí**  Q)  **‚àß** P) **‚Üí**  Q

C) Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

But surely the same problem still applies? Could all the premises of this argument be true while the conclusion remains false? A third argument must therefore be presented.

So, essentially, I‚Äôm looking for either works by renowned philosophers that I could read myself or your own arguments that are grounded in human sense data. I‚Äôm not an empiricist myself, but I think that this would be a strong place to start with my inquiry.

I have considered myself to be agnostic, leaning atheist for quite some time. I was raised Catholic but became a hardline atheist at about 17 after about four years of questioning. I then became agnostic at about 19, after study in topics unrelated to theology. The biggest contributor being epistemology.

With that said, I haven‚Äôt had much contact with the arguments in favor of religion and the existence of God. It seems to me that a lot of the arguments by influential people within religions are very much based on them getting their followers to affirm their own cognitive biases or reject logic for the vague notion of faith. Because of that alone, I‚Äôve had a tendency in the past to write off any notion of God. However, marketing is marketing. Just because marketing uses emotional persuasion doesn‚Äôt mean the message is actually false, it just means that this is the way in which their audience is persuaded. Additionally, the argument for religion should be separated from the argument for God. 

To contrast my experience, or lack thereof, with arguments in favor of the existence of God, Ive had lots of experience with arguments against it. I‚Äôve taken quite a few courses in the philosophy department at my University, which is quite heavily focused on religion and God. The department, however, is largely atheist, and aggressively so.

I‚Äôve, for quite some time, been obsessed with the idea of coming to something as close as possible to the objective truth about the world.

My mom's first answer was ""no, because stealing is wrong."" I interrogated her further, and she changed her answer to ""no, because if I stole we would both go to hell, and if I didn't stole we would both have a chance at going to heaven"".

My dad's answer was ""I would do anything to save her."" I asked him whether he would do this to save someone he does not know, and he said he wouldn't.

My answer would be yes, because when a social system puts someone in a situation where they have to steal to save someone's life it is not legitimate, and its rules do not apply. The inalienable human rights trump over socially defined rules.

136,"Lately I have been reading different books about metaethics. One thing in particular struck me: The whole discussion is almost exclusively about individuals, about their cognition, their emotions, their attitudes...  In my opinion it is obvious that morality (unlike for example perception or - to a certain degree - cognition) is primarily a social phenomenon. 

Question: Is there no author in metaethics who has adapted the ideas of Searle (""The Construction of Social reality"", especially his theory of 'institutional facts'), Berger/Luckmann (""The Social Construction of reality"") or Henry Plotkin (""The Imagined World made real"") ?

&amp;#x200B;

Especially those who subscribe to moral realism, and who claim that moral statements like 'Slavery is wrong' refer to some sort of mind-independent reality which can be known or perceived through intuition, cannot really explain the nature of this strange 'moral reality'. 

But Searle or Berger/Luckmann are able to provide exactly the kind of theories that explain this intermediate reality between on the one side objective reality  (planets, trees , viruses ...)  and on the other side subjective reality  (my feelings or opinions). But the concept of 'social' or 'intersubjective' reality is not mentioned in the books on metaethics which I have read.

&amp;#x200B;

This intersubjective reality is on the one hand  mind-dependent, but its entities do not depend on individual minds. The proposition ""slavery is morally wrong"" would therefore be analogous to ""Ottawa is the capital of Canada"": both do not refer to objective nor to subjective reality  (a ""capital""  does not exist in the same way as a tree; and it is not a feeling or opinion). In both cases the truth does not depend on my mind or opinion (or on that of any other individual), but it depends on the minds and opinions of a sufficient large number of people.",Is my impression correct that the concept of social / intersubjective reality is absent from metaethics?

167,"I am sorry if I am not posting to the right sub but I need help with understanding philosophy and its study. Is philosophy something we as individuals can build on? Or rather should I say, is it wrong for me to form my own philosophical beliefs without building off those that have already been said? I have been contemplating the philosophy of our own existence over the past few days, but doing so without researching philosophy beforehand. I don't know if this is against philosophy, but in thinking about philosophy and trying to ""understand"" our existence, or figure out ""our purpose"", I started with the fact that nothing beyond my own existence is ""knowable"" or at least known to be ""true"". Based on this, all of my own philosophy has to at least originate from my own existence.  

In basically all other areas of study, you learn the material first. Like you would teach someone math before they were able to do it. If someone conceives of the idea of ""math"" on their own, their is no guarantee that their ""version"" of math is the same as the majority's view on math. Numbers are arbitrary, so if someone forms their own version of math based on only their existence and says 1+1=3, its not wrong in nature but only wrong to those who already have a different concept of math formed. 

Anyways, obviously, if each individual had their own version of math, language, etc. the societal world would have major conflict, however, is this true of philosophy? Are the philosophical ideas I look at internally pointless to everyone else? I guess this is a multi-part question, sorry, but what I really was wondering is if what I have been doing is Philosophy, then is there a philosophical belief that is based on what I have thought of below? Can anyone point me in the direction of where this sort of idea already exists in philosophy? I assume it either already exists or there are major flaws in it, so thank you to anyone who could help point those out too. 

Basically, From my own consciousness or being, I was able to form ""three levels of existence"" 

1. Personal Being Existence
2. Perceived External Existence
3. Societal Existence

You might be able to pick up on what I am trying to say, what this relates to already just based on that, but if not here are more details into each: 

***Personal Being Existence*** 

* The first principle of our existence. Multi leveled. Is it strictly the individuals' experience? True ownership?
* Where instinctive knowledge and ideas are held. Concepts that can‚Äôt truly be explained to others.  Ex, the person experience of colors, and emotions cant be truly defined.

***Perceived Physical/External Existence***   

* The five senses: sight, sound, touch, feel, and taste, all act as a bridge between the perceived physical/external and the existence of the personal being. External stimuli is perceived information taken in and understood at the personal being level of existence. 
* The ‚Äúfirst-hand‚Äù experience of an individual. Individual has personally.
* The overall perception of the physical world around us and its constant state. 
* ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù Rules of laws in this plane and its constant state of being support its existence and allow for certain observations to be met

***Societal Existence***

* Communication within perceived external existence acts as a bridge between the personal being existence and the society existence. 
* The existence of knowledge, ideas, and concepts formed by society, and interactions with other individuals. 
* Where social constructs are derived from, things like race, gender, currency 
* Ideas are not routed in the perceived external existence, rather they are formed when combining thoughts from different personal beings' existences",Am I allowed to form philosophical ideas myself and is this already a popular idea in philosophy?,askphilosophy

Seldom does a person have a struggle with the fact that there was a time when they didn't exist. I'd wager that the majority of people haven't even pondered the thought. 

Why, then, do we have such a difficult time with the fact (or at least the possibility) that there will inevitably be a time when we no longer exist?

Nearly everything we observe in life has a literal or at least figurative season to it. I.e. the seasons: Spring is a birth and Winter a death. The most obvious and relatable example being people in our lives living and then dying. 

With an acceptance of our non-existence before our birth and the countless observations in our lives that should condition us to our coming non-existence again, why do we struggle so much with this concept?

Is it vanity? Is it an instinctual drive to survive, no matter the obstacle? Is it just pure fear of the unknown?

173,"A few years ago I started reading After Life, by Eugene Thacker. Although I didn‚Äôt got sidetracked one thing that stuck with me is the parallels between biological life and ethical judgment. In essence, Thacker argues that attempting to define life runs into the problem of encompassing every species/worldview in existence and how life is inherently emergent as new species form (I suppose the ethical version is how new arguments can be created and lifestyles also exist independent from their ethical merits).

I‚Äôve also been interested in Hume‚Äôs guillotine for a while, and the combination of these two influences has left me perpetually anxious; my internal desire for certain outcomes in the world and recognition that ethics is embedded in neurological activity / subjective / doesn‚Äôt count for much in a variety of contexts. Ultimately I end up at a point where I can see one possible explanation is that reality sucks and ethics don‚Äôt matter, but one still has to live in the world, which my intellectual paralysis interferes with. 

To me it seems like the best thing to do would be to finish After Life, read some of the sources Thacker uses (e.g. he refers to biopolitics, and uses excerpts from De Anima to illustrate Aristotle‚Äôs conception of biology), and Hume.

178,"I've decided I'm an absurdist anarchist. My logic is, politics (along with fundamental metaphysics) makes no sense, so anything I do doesn't make sense, but doing nothing makes no sense either. Any basis I could provide for my political or moral action will fall apart like all the grandiose metaphysical projects before and after Pyrrho, and Pyrrho's response to his own skepticism isn't any better justified than anyone else's.

Although as an underpriviliged person my political actions look more quietism, and I often feel like a quietist, when I imagine projecting my political will outward, it looks more like radically egalitarian anarchism. Disempower everyone over everyone else, and make people too equal to enact their own bullshit ideas. This incorporates absurdism, because attempts to make sense of the world fail and so should political action based on it, but also in the fact that my idea doesn't make sense either, and absurdist authoritarianism is as good as my idea or better, for all I know.

What strikes me as apparent about my motive is the fact that I'm compelled to do it prior to any reasoning. I feel strongly against anyone having anyone having power over me, and I don't like having any power myself. When people have tried to overpower me, I resist it. When people try to treat me like an authority, it feels inauthentic and I hate it. I feel prideful of the times I've given people free associative power based on sharing perspective to make their own decisions when giving ""advice"", and I make it an art form not to tell people what to do burn verbally craft actual advice in the least authoritarian way possible and leave it to their judgment. I also hate getting advice I don't ask for. It's a matter of an extension of my psychological instinct that I flatten the curve of the power landscape when I can. I just gotta.

Putting aside the probable reality that absurdism is not truly justified and maybe my idea doesn't make sense (appropriately), I'm curious what other possible motive can drive a person to a metaphysical, moral, or political idea other than our own passionate drive toward a thing under no guidance than our inner psychology moving us forward.

183,"I realise that my question has been oddly phrased, so I hope that my question would make more sense with elaboration.

Like most people with more than a passing interest in ""French theory"" eg. Deleuze, Derrida, Serres, Lacan, I've been looking up more about the intellectual atmosphere they were in. All of them did to some extent draw upon each other, but of course they did exist in a wider French philosophical academia, and that's what I'm interested in.

I've been looking up issues of the journal *Cahiers pour l‚ÄôAnalyse*, and I was surprised at how ""analytic"" some of the papers were, treating mathematics, epistemology and formalization, and how analytic philosophers like Bertrand Russell and some of their intellectual forebears, like G√∂del, Wittgenstein, Frege were re-printed or discussed here alongside articles by Derrida, Foucault, Lacan. 

It also seems that Derrida very early on translated and published an essay by W. V. O. Quine, ""*Les Fronti√®res de la Th√©orie Logique*"", Serres claimed in his book with Latour that he was one of the first professors to teach mathematical logic after Russell and Whitehead, Jean Wahl apparently translated some early analytic philosophy together with the pragmatists and Whitehead, and of course there's the 1958 Royaumont Colloquium on analytic philosophy in France. Quite a few of the obscurer French philosophers cited and footnoted in Deleuze and Guattari's *What is Philosophy* are labelled by Wikipedia as analytic philosophers, like Gilles-Gaston Granger, and apparently Deleuze's reference to Wittgenstein's followers as being assassins of philosophy might have been a reference to a prominent French Wittgensteinian.

I guess it's obvious that the ""French theory"" generation of Deleuze, Derrida, Serres, Badiou, Lacan, were all rather familiar with analytic philosophy, if my examples are all right. So I'm wondering what was the reception of analytic philosophy in their circles, how much of a presence it had in French academia, how it was responded to, and how well-read one might assume Lacan or whoever would be in the analytic tradition. Unfortunately, I don't have any French, so I'm finding it hard really hard to find anything on this on the Net.",What sort of reception/importance did analytic/anglophone philosophy have in France among continental philosophers?,askphilosophy

For context. I'm a PhD student at a ""mid tier"" program. Generally, I have it quite nice. I have an advisor who supports my research. Our interests align very well. I am very well funded and live in a good area. 

Yet, I am also young. I came to the PhD straight from undergrad and am the youngest in my subfield by many years. Not to boast, but at times it feels that I am a bit over qualified for my department. I have a forthcoming publication in the early stages of the PhD and have been told by a few professors that I have great potential (again, really not trying to brag here. Just trying to explain my situation. I am normally very critical of myself but I know my academic potential). With that all said, my research interests are very unique for my field at large, and I fear that if I stay at my current university I'll have a very tough time securing an academic job. Again, I wonder that I set my bar too low coming out of undergrad, given my age. I can't help but feel that, since I'm young, I might as well try and better my career opportunities down the road.

185,"A real life dilemma that I'm hoping you philosophers could maybe weigh in on. It's a very basic problem but one that I find incredibly hard to answer.

I want to join the army. However, I tend to get hung up on moral dilemmas. Especially so in this case.

I've briefly worked as a war reporter. The things I've seen during this time have made me want to join the army - something I never even considered before. I guess seeing the impactful way soldiers can help during a conflict - not just protecting civilians but also coordinating evacuations, refugee camps etc. - has made me reconsider all my prior notions about the military. I really feel as though I can do more for people now as a soldier than I can as a reporter - especially as I'm still relatively young and able bodied. I mean, I can be a reporter until I'm grey and crippled. The window to serve in the military is much smaller. And I also think I'll be a better reporter after actually having experienced the military from the inside. 

However, the ethical dilemma of course is the very real probability that I'll have to actually shoot at people. I think it's one of the last things any sane person would want to do. On the flip side, sometimes combat is necessary, and having soldiers willing to engage in combat could mean life or death for innocent people. Why should I enjoy the luxury of not having to face the possibility of inflicting violence on someone while other people keep me safe by doing so? It's like the ethical dilemma of eating meat and not wanting to butcher the animal. 

Of course, protecting innocent people from nefarious forces is an ideal scenario. In most conflicts, the situation is way more muddled. For example, booting ISIS from a town would, by much of the world's moral measures, be the right thing to do, as quality of life is generally terrible for most people under ISIS rule. On the other hand, the ISIS soldiers you kill while doing so are often kids who have been primed for radicalisation by the past actions of the same ""ex""-colonial power you are fighting for. 

In isolation, killing another human being is always a bad thing. But on the other hand, letting extremist/genocidal groups do whatever they want to innocent people is bad too, no matter what drove them to such actions. 

So, is it morally better to never fight and ignore the suffering you could have helped to prevent, or to willingly use violence against people - who may have been forced into conflict by circumstances beyond their control - in order to prevent the suffering of innocents?

To be clear: I'm not a US citizen. The country who's army I would join is more into peacekeeping than geo-political play. So at least there is that. But still.",Is it immoral to want to be a soldier?,askphilosophy

I do realize that the psychoanalytic perspective, no matter what, still is important from an idea historical perspective.

&gt;This level of smug pseudo-intellectual idiocy requires a fisking.  In order to reduce repetitiveness, it should be noted that there are abnormal cases of non ‚ÄúXX‚Äù or ‚ÄúXY‚Äù chormosome pairings (e.g. XO, XXY), or of a body developing in utero contra to chomosomes, but those are rare and not indicative of a ‚Äúsocial norm‚Äù of recognizing that the vast majority of people are indeed women or men, a fact confirmed by not only our entire history as a species, but of practically every other mammalian species in existance.

 &gt;Further, it will reduce repetitiveness to point out basic biological reality: A ‚ÄúY‚Äù chromosome in lieu of a second ‚ÄúX‚Äù chromosome is like a fork in the road that instructs the biological program (i.e. DNA) to develop the body and mind along that of a woman (when no ‚ÄúY‚Äù chromosome is present), or that of a man (when there is a ‚ÄúY‚Äù chromosome).  Men and women are physically and physiologically distinct from each other on a clear statistical basis.  There is not gradual spectrum.  You have two distinct averages with outliers that at the extremes can overlap, like two Gaussian curves.  Outside of the previously mentioned biological abnormalities, this holds true, and does so for the vast majority of the population.

This article is one of a few I've read in the past few hours. I actually got started on this by a quote from Neil Gaiman on writing:

""Remember: when people tell you something‚Äôs wrong or doesn‚Äôt work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.""

This led me down my current rabbit hole: What can we know about what we like and dislike if our rationalisations and justifications after the fact cannot be trusted? I won't lie it's giving me a mild existential crisis - that something so simple as what I like and dislike is beyond my comprehension.

But enough of this, what do Philosophers make of this? What are the limits of Introspection and what are its merits?

It goes something like this: 

Imagine I give you access to any time or place in existence and ask you to bring me all the apples that ever existed. 
Would it be possible? 

Let‚Äôs ignore the time and space constraints for a moment. 

What I‚Äôm interested in is, if it is possible to unambiguously define an apple. 

Imo it is not possible because it is just a spectrum of possible forms existence can take. It‚Äôs a seamless transition from what can be called an apple and what can‚Äôt in taxonomy. 
Not a hard line. 


Plato explained it like this in his allegory of the cave, and theory of forms (If I understood correctly) 

The apples we see in our world are like shadow representations of the one true apple. That exists as immutable perfect object in the world of forms. 

I would put a slight variation in that instead of the apple existing as a separate form from all other forms. 

There is only one form in the world of forms that is the basis for everything we can perceive in existence. 

Imagine it like a Mandelbrot that is held in front of the light source in the cave.
Instead of many separate shapes it is just the fractals on the Mandelbrot that can appear as infinitely many different shapes. As we keep zooming in or zooming out. 


So, do Apples exist? 
As an absolutely defined individual existence, no they do not exist. 

As a small part of the Mandelbrot fractals that are sufficiently different from other parts so they can be distinguished.

225,"I would consider myself a speculative realist. I am broadly materialist, and I'm highly influenced by Marxism and Camus. I'm staunchly opposed to essentialism and idealism in most of its forms.

However, this leaves me in a quandary in regards to my ethics. At the broadest level, I believe in a form of moral relativism, inasmuch as I do not hold morality to be ""real."" Nevertheless, ascribing all ethics to societal constructs and material conditions doesn't sit right with me. I feel that it hobbles our ability to talk about morals comparatively, as well as being a pretty poor basis to build an emotional worldview off of.

Virtue ethics, on the other hand, are also insufficient. One doesn't even have to crack open a history book to see all of the ways in which various virtues such as honor, purity, patriotism etc have a pervasive tendency to be weaponized in service of great harm. In my view, when the essence of a virtue is treated as natural and universal, it always eventually becomes a tool in service of the dominant ideology. 

The only compromise that I've been able to reach is something that I call ""monoethics,"" and I think it's best put into words via this quote by Kurt Vonnegut: ""The purpose of life, whoever is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved."" The gist of it is that, since I consider the world and other people to be fundamentally ""real,"" my main concern should be the treatment of the universe with compassion. All other virtues are founded on ascribing essential value to certain behaviors and people without material basis, and should thus be treated with suspicion. 

It's like I'm a virtue ethicist, but I only believe in one virtue (love, compassion, altruism, something to that effect). Human behavior and character can/should only be judged by their adherence to the one virtue.

I'm aware that this is also a form of idealism, that I cannot objectively substantiate why ""love"" is inherently good or desirable. But it's an idealistic leap that is small enough that I'm generally comfortable with it.

[Utilitarianism FAQ page](http://dragice.fr/utilitarianism/faq.html) on the internet agrees with this as as well saying: 
&gt; Empiricism is very important to Utilitarianism because Utilitarianism says that the morally best actions are those which produce the greatest welfare in practice. Figuring out what will produce the greatest welfare in the real world is a complex practical issue. Utilitarianism tells us what goal to work toward, giving us a standard to measure our actions against. Empiricism is necessary to tell us how to achieve the goal.

Are there any philosophers that talk in more detail about this connection?

243,"""Hence, it will be found that the fundamental fault of the female character is that it has no sense of justice. This is mainly due to the fact, already mentioned, that women are defective in the powers of reasoning and deliberation; but it is also traceable to the position that Nature has assigned to them as the weaker sex. They are dependent, not upon strength, but upon craft; and hence their instinctive capacity for cunning, and their ineradicable tendency to say what is not true. For as lions are provided with claws and teeth, and elephants and boars with tusks, bulls with horns, and cuttlefish with its clouds of inky fluid, so Nature has equipped woman, for her defense and protection, with the arts of dissimulation; and all the power which Nature has conferred upon man in the shape of physical strength and reason has been bestowed upon women in this form. Hence, dissimulation is innate in women, and almost as much a quality of the stupid as of the clever. It is as natural for them to make use of it on every occasion as it is for those animals to employ their means of defense when they are attacked; they have a feeling that in doing so they are only within their rights. Therefore a woman who is perfectly truthful and not given to dissimulation is perhaps an impossibility, and for this very reason, they are so quick at seeing through dissimulation in others that it is not a wise thing to attempt it with them. But this fundamental defect which I have stated, with all that it entails, gives rise to falsity, faithlessness, treachery, ingratitude, and so on. Perjury in a court of justice is more often committed by women than by men. It may, indeed, be generally questioned whether women ought to be sworn in at all.""

My understanding of causal determinism is that it dictates that everything happens as a result of previous causes (to simplify things extremely). However, the situation I was wondering about is this: say one was able to gain sufficient understanding of all the forces of the universe and given states/locations of all objects etc that would essentially allow them to properly predict the future in its entirety. They then write down the details of precisely what is to happen. If you were to view this document, and find out that in five seconds time you are ‚Äòdestined‚Äô to say ‚Äúhello‚Äù, is there anything stopping you from at that point, in five seconds instead saying ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù? It seems to me that most actions people take are not governed entirely by necessity, and it is entirely plausible that one of the actions you are fated to do is voluntary enough that it would not be difficult for you to do something different instead. Assuming this is possible though, it would contradict the causal determinist‚Äôs prediction, even though it is based on full accurate knowledge of what is to come.

Such an occurrence would not necessarily refute determinism itself - all that is happening is that the current causal laws are being superseded by other, unknown ones that render the existing ones inaccurate. However, would it would arguable mean that determinism is only able to act on us in ways that are unknown to us - as soon as we become aware of how it is ‚Äòsupposed‚Äô to act on us, we become able to contradict that given way.

The rock won't change it's behavior because of it's very tiny conscious experience, and the rock won't have this meta awareness. Get a little bit more complex and you get a virus that is slightly more conscious but again the virus won't change it's behaviors based on the consciousness and the virus won't be have the meta awareness either.

26,"My basic understanding of this philosophy is as follows:

We should try to prioritize reducing suffering for as many people as possible while adhering to their preferences.

This worldview tries to deal with the criticism of utilitarianism laid out in ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"", by avoiding promoting societies where a lot of people benefit from the suffering of a few.

It also tries to deal with the criticism of classic negative utilitarianism, where a logical actor could support the extinction of life to avoid future suffering, by taking into account people and animals general preference to be alive.

If we ever hypothetically got to the point where unnecessary suffering was eliminated, then we could switch to classic preference utilitarianism (to try to promote joy).

--

I. If x is the same thing as y, then the question ""I know it's x, but is it y?"" would be meaningless

II. The question ""I know it's x, but is it good?"" where x is some natural property is meaningful.

Therefore, good cannot be defined in terms of natural properties.

--

The thing I'm having trouble with is the second premise. If I said ""I know he's a bachelor, but is he unmarried?"" the question would seem to only reflect that I don't know what the heck the word ""bachelor"" means. But isn't he assuming that that isn't the case with the question ""I know it's x, but is it good?""

In other words, couldn't it just be the case that, since it's possible that simply no one is properly informed on what ""good"" means, ""x is good"" could be a question of identity? Isn't he assuming it isn't, just because the two terms ""feel"" different?

For example. Let's say that no one on Earth knew what ""bachelor"" meant. So if someone asked ""I know he's a bachelor, but is he unmarried?"" that would seem like a genuinely meaningful question. In the same way, couldn't it be the case that ""x is good"" where x is some natural property, for example ""'pleasurable' is 'good'"", is genuinely a question of identity, it's just no one knows the true nature of good, so it feels like a meaningful question to ask?

87,"In his _History of Western Philosophy_, Bertrand Russell says that some of the Ancient Greek philosophies were essentially for the aristocracy as they focused on happiness in this life, whereas religions like Christianity gained popularity because their promise of bliss in the afterlife appealed to the lower classes, for whom happiness in this life might seem impossible. 

Russell says that Judaism transitioned from aristocratic to lower-class-focused during the Roman occupation because the devout Jews were so persecuted that they could no longer believe in promises of rewards for virtue in this life, and so had to believe that they would be rewarded in the afterlife instead.

It is my impression that at least _some_ of the Ancient Egyptian religious traditions were highly aristocratic because you needed expensive embalming and burial rituals in order to get into the good afterlife, whereas the poor were doomed to suffering or oblivion after death. 

Do you know of any sources (books, articles, essays, videos) that explore this topic further - i.e., the differences between religions and philosophies for the lower classes and those for the upper classes, with examples of both?

89,"Most big/reoccuring topics in philosophy are such that philosophers can admit and agree that there are good arguments for both/several positions regardless of their own position. 

While some arguments convince us immediately (eg. by showing a contradiction maybe) and those philosophically educated seem to scoff at others who don't accept it (a consensus position) most arguments don't lead to a consensus in philosophy.

Even so, any specific philosopher usually has a definitely preferred position.

How do you rationally weigh the pros and cons of a subject matter?

Why is it that some arguments convince some while others are completely unaffected? Is it confirmation bias to a previously held belief, a post hoc rationalization?

90,"I've arrived at a fundamental definition of evil. This definition is applicable to humans only.

""Evil is when people believe that it is okay to non consensually dominate others for no other reason than to satisfy their own ego. Anyone who dominates others without their consent is committing an act of evil.""

I arrived at this conclusion mainly due to points mentioned below.
1. All species yearn for survival in the best possible way.
2. Most species relied on power to dominate and create environments suitable for them. Even gorrillas , one of the closest cousins of humans, have a system of having the most powerful male lead the pack.
3. The reason humans were able to dominate other species was not because of raw power, which we have very little of, but due to intra species collaboration. 
4. So it's essentially **Domination** vs **Collaboration**.  Ultimately our puny species came out on top, literally with the power of friendship and collaboration. 
5. Thus in the context of humans, collaboration is good. Effective communication, knowledge sharing, protecting vulnerable members, sacrificing self pleasure for the good of the tribe etc are all characteristics of collaboration.
6. Since we evolved from other species that used Domination as a survival mechanism , we humans also must have vestigial deep rooted beliefs in our brain that tell us Domination is good. A vestigial behaviour just like hiccups that do us no good. Essentially it boils down to an internal fight between **the billion year old doctrine of domination vs the million year old doctrine of collaboration.** This is what I think is the fight between Evil and Good that has existed ever since humans existed. A conflict between legacy firmware and the more effective latest firmware. 

I think it is this ""Doctrine of Domination"" which we call as Evil. It is probably baked so hard in our genes that it is tough or even impossible to get out. The only way to counter this is to overrule it with the ""Doctrine of Collaboration"" (aka Good) that is much more recent and borne out of our new fangled human intellect. It takes much human intellect, training, and will power to do the ""right thing"" without falling prey to our primitive tendencies.

96,"Hello, I'm an uneducated, armchair, philosopher and I've been toying with an odd bit of logic that I'd like others to take a look at. I'm not sure where I've picked this up and any help with sourcing this, cleaning it up, or picking it apart would be greatly appreciated. Anyway the thought's as follows:

If we assume a deterministic structure, further assume from there an epistemological binary of 'known and unknown,' then decisionless agents (people) within the deterministic structure, who do not have full knowledge of the structure itself, must treat whatever knowledge they have of determinism as an 'unknown.' Therefore behaving within the structure as if the structure itself (even if assumed true for this problem) does or does not exist.

Ultimately my thought is that the nature of determinism itself, if it created absolute 'known/unknowns' would preclude acting perfectly on the knowledge of it's existence. (If knowledge of the whole was unobtainable)

So does that mean determinist arguments can't ever be 'perfect' even if determinism is assumed true? What about logic in general? (Early Wittgenstein) Does that extend forever, like is there a constant of chance of error from some kind of inexorable doubt?

Many years ago I created a theory explaining humor, and months later I stumbled upon an incredibly similar, established theory explaining humor in the philosophy of humor known as the Benign Violation Theory (BVT). Discovering this was very validating.

Currently, I am trying to understand and create a theory for a specific aspect of social validation, and I've not found anything in the literature on this specific aspect of social validation.

This is why I've come here, to seek some help from fellow philosophers. Here's my thought process:

Fulfillment of a need yields pleasure. Eating when hungry. Scratching an itch. Covering with a blanket when cold.

Receiving genuine, heart-felt compliments or praise from others is typically pleasurable, which means, it fulfills a need. 

But what is this need exactly.. it appears clear to me that it boils down to a need to feel safe and secure, but what's not clear to me is, in what sense and how..

is it a need to feel confident about one's own abilities, or is it a need to feel you can rely on others..

and if it is about feeling confident about one's own abilities, is that ultimately because it guarantees that others will love you for your qualities and therefor back you.. or is it because belief in one's abilities to achieve is necessary to access that ability in the first place..

Say a girl and guy are attracted to each other, and the girl is attracted to the guy because he is intelligent, and compliments the guy by saying he's smart.

Does that make the guy feel good, solely because it is an affirmation that the girl finds his qualities appreciable, and hence an affirmation that he has a chance with her..

Or does it make him feel good first and foremost, because it gives him the confidence that he is in fact intelligent, which grants him not only her appreciation and love, but the potential appreciation of others.. and also enables him to face and solve his own problems that would require intelligence.. 

the latter seems more comprehensive and inclusive, but the problem there for me is, why should her affirmation give him the confidence that others would view him as intelligent.. in fact it is certain that people would rate his intelligence differently to her.. Also, who is she to judge intelligence.. why should that give him the confidence to solve complex problems requiring intelligence..

So is the former or the latter a more accurate explanation then.. I'm lost.. 

To ask the question from another angle also, is a compliment 

A) a payment in and of itself

or is it 

B) a promise of payment

If someone gives me money, that's both something I can use, AND it tells me I have that person's appreciation and support, and that I can rely on them in the future..

If someone gives me a compliment, does it just say I can rely on that person in the future because they value a quality I have, or is this compliment something I can use, and if so, in light of everything mentioned till now, how exactly? 

Insights to all the above would be highly appreciated.",Which of these theories/analogies best explain social validation on a philosophical level?,askphilosophy

For example: often people don‚Äôt take depression very seriously unless they are worried you will do something ‚Äúbad‚Äù.  It can get very frustrating to be in so much pain and have others not really taking it serious.

Also someone might feel like they need to be hospitalized and attentively cared for  because of the severity of there condition even if not suicidal, to get a feeling of validation, legitimacy and coverage from insurance one might say they are suicidal. To clarify, I think people very rarely engage in deliberately false lies, rather they can convince themselves that something is true if it is conducive to a goal based on deeper motivations and the incentive structure of the system.

153,"It is quite long. However, the writing itself is not too difficult, so hopefully it is not too much to ask. 

""You think that shepherds and cowherds seek the good of their sheep and cattle, and fatten them and take care of them, looking to something other than their master's good and their own. Moreover, you believe that rulers in cities-true rulers, that is-think about their subjects differently than one does about sheep, and that night and day they think of something besides their own advantage. You are so far from understanding about justice and what's just, about injustice and what's unjust, that you don't realize that justice is really the good of another, the advantage of the stronger and the ruler, and harmful to the one who obeys and serves. Injustice is the opposite, it rules the truly simple and just, and those it rules do what is to the advantage of the other and stronger, and they make the one they serve happy, but themselves not at  all. You must look at it as follows, my most simple Socrates: A just man always gets less than an unjust one. First, in their contracts with one another, you'll never find, when the partnership ends, that a just partner has got more than an unjust one, but less. Second, in matters relating to the city, when taxes are to be paid, a just man pays more on the same property, an unjust one less, but when the city is giving out refunds, a just man gets nothing, while an unjust one makes a large profit. Finally, when each of them holds a ruling position in some public office, a just person, even if he isn't penalized in other ways, finds that his private affairs deteriorate because he has to neglect them, that he gains no advantage from the public purse because of his justice, and that he's hated by his relatives and acquaintances when he's unwilling to do them an unjust favor. The opposite is true of an unjust man in every respect. \*\*Therefore, I repeat what I said before: A person of great power outdoes everyone else.\*\* Consider him if you want to figure out how much more advantageous it is for the individual to be just rather than unjust. You'll understand this most easily if you tum your thoughts to the most complete injustice, the one that makes the doer of injustice happiest and the sufferers of it, who are unwilling to do injustice, most wretched. \*\*This is tyranny, which through stealth or force appropriates the property of others, whether sacred or profane, public or private, not little by little, but all at once. If someone commits only one part of injustice and is caught, he's punished and greatly reproached-such partly unjust people are called temple-robbers, kidnappers, housebreakers, robbers, and thieves when they commit these crimes. But when someone, in addition to appropriating their possessions, kidnaps and enslaves the citizens as well, instead of these shameful names he is called happy and blessed, not only by the citizens themselves, but by all who learn that he has done the whole of injustice. Those who reproach injustice do so because they are afraid not of doing it but of suffering it. So, Socrates, injustice, if it is on a large enough scale, is stronger, freer, and more masterly than justice. And, as I said from the first, justice is what is advantageous to the stronger, while injustice is to one's own profit and advantage.""

I am wondering about the sections that are bolded. Firstly, what is the antecedent when Thrasymachus says, ""Therefore, I repeat what I said before: A person of great power outdoes everyone else""? My only guess is that it is when he says, ""You must look at it as follows, my most simple Socrates: A just man always gets less than an unjust one."" But I cannot tell if that is the previous statement to which he's referring. 

The section about tyranny is also quite confusing to me. Is Thrasymachus arguing that, if a tyrant only appropriates the property of others without also enslaving them, that he would not be praised and blessed? He seems to define tyranny, first as the appropriation of others' possessions, and then as something over and above that: namely, the enslavement of the people as well as their property.

As I understand, science as a concept makes sense of the universe by testing and observation, this requires the assumption that the universe can be made sense of. 

If a concept arrives that itself cannot be observed in any way by man, it seems reasonable that the assumption would be that the concept itself makes sense, however we simply do not have the tools or capacity to make sense of it.

But what is the reason we assume it can be made sense of? We can only make sense of things that we can make sense of.

182,"I say ""precluding egoism"", because I assume concern for others could be invoked by a compassion or fairness motive which most people have. I also say ""general"", because I can imagine some particulars where one could argue we ought to sacrifice our well being, like to sell our sports car for our kids and buy a minivan, but I'd like to get some big picture categorical concerns, because I'm in a jam philosophically.

You see, I recently had my entire philosophy of life imploded by someone else's basic critical thought. I don't regard it as a big deal, however, because in addition to the fact that I get to make a whole new philosophy, the output in my ethics suffices to me: I am well in some mode of being, and I ought to try to be well, barring practical obstruction. Seems simple to me. Almost too simple.

I conceive two general families of ethical limits to securing well being: Compassion and (universal) love, and fairness and relationships. Compassion and love demand we give of ourselves to others if they need it and we can do so, and fairness and relationships require us to fulfill our obligations equitably, admitting partiality and permitting voluntarism. Justice is a mixed idea which can be conceived along either lines. I don't think any religious idea I've heard of sacrifices well being of the believer, although for justice reasons again, the damned are condemned.

So that's compassion, love, fairness, relationships, and justice. Personally, fairness and relationships are tied into my well being, and I like equitable terms and partiality, so I don't view that as any limit. I reject compassion and (universal) love. I'm curious, then, if there is any limit other than the list I've given.

I can think of a confusing way to conceive the question where one can admit they are sacrificing their well being for something greater besides those things, like career, money, sex, fame, power, changing the world, achievement, approval, or any mundane thing, and affirm that sacrifice, but then ask whether they are not then being well, and if not, if that is relevant because they may not ought to do it. It also calls into terms a large range of ideas which dilute the general aim of my post, which is to try to think about what major idea besides well being might challenge my own norms about what is good, so I can reasonably be answerable to my own doubt about the matter, and might direct me to higher order concerns than such particulars.

My hope is to ground my ""I should try to be well"" principle in reasonable satisfaction with myself.

185,"
In Capital, Marx declares that the exchange value of a good is primarily determined by the amount of socially necessary labor time needed to produce it.

The amount of labor time deemed ‚Äúsocially necessary‚Äù is functionally determined by demand; consumers‚Äô willingness to purchase a good deems how socially necessary the labor that went into its production truly was. With that said, Marx‚Äôs theory of value, as I understand it, essentially keeps the demand side of a supply-and-demand model intact, while attributing the creation of supply solely to labor power. 

I‚Äôve lately read a few significant challenges to Marx‚Äôs theory of value and some of them are rather strong. I‚Äôm curious to hear anyone‚Äôs rebuttals or insights into how their weight would effect Marxist analysis.

1. Marx‚Äôs theory of value only applies under perfect competition. 

When produced under imperfect competition or monopoly, the exchange value of a good would be greater than under perfect competition, despite its being produced with the same amount of labor time. Ernest Mandel‚Äôs response is the best I‚Äôve seen: ‚ÄúIt is precisely through competition that it is discovered whether the amount of labor embodied in a commodity constitutes a socially necessary amount of not‚Ä¶ When, however, supply is less than demand, that means that less human labor has been expended on producing the commode in question than was socially necessary.‚Äù 

2. While the theory of value employed by Marx makes an attempt to distinguish between skilled and unskilled labor, it does not distinguish between different types of skilled and unskilled labor. 

This results in a theoretical situation where  two workers of equal skill devote equal amounts of labor time to the creation of two different products, A and B. If the value of A is greater than the value of B, what causes the difference? This is a problem Ricardo struggled to address, merely stating (in a way similar to Mandel‚Äôs quote above) that ‚Äúright relation by the play of the market mechanism‚Äù would sort out the correct relative prices for the goods in question. Again, one is arguing that the difference in the social necessity of the goods dictates the difference in value, but that feels like another way of simply saying supply (while continuing to exclude any value-adding role for capital). 

3. Marx‚Äôs theory of value never truly accounts for the returns of capital

We all know that capital is the end-product of some previous worker‚Äôs socially necessary labor time. It could follow that capital is sold at its true value. (By this I mean to say that it‚Äôs sale price is equal to the net value it contributes to the productive process throughout its lifetime). But I don‚Äôt think anyone believes this. Marx didn‚Äôt. If capital is sold for a price beneath its true value, we have 2 options that I‚Äôm aware of:

1. That capital has some independent rate of return (which neoclassical economists would call the marginal productivity of capital).
2. That capital has value because it is the product of the exploitation of some past laborers (who did not received in remuneration the ‚Äútrue value‚Äù of the capital they produced)

Both answers seem unsatisfying. In (1), the marginal productivity of capital is merely deduced by assuming that the marginal productivity of labor is equal to its compensation. In (2), we‚Äôre given an explanation for how capital could ‚Äúindependently‚Äù produce value, but only by looking into past exploitation, and not present production, though it‚Äôs obvious that capital can enhance the productivity of labor independent of the exploitation that went into that capital‚Äôs formation. 

Trying to suss out an objective rate of return of capital seems a fool‚Äôs errand, for capital only has value when mixed with labor, yet labor‚Äôs value can be significantly enhanced with the addition of capital. 

It seems to me that Marx‚Äôs theory of value has more rhetorical than theoretical thrust. Clearly capital plays a bigger role than is let on, but it‚Äôs a seemingly immeasurable one, that is overdetermined by a variety of objective and subjective economic forces. But, by embracing a labor theory of value, Marx encourages workers to take up an empowering truth: capital is worthless without their labor, and they should reap the full fruits of production. It‚Äôs a sentiment I‚Äôm sympathetic to, but I worry we miss something by failing to understand the true nature of capital. 

I think we can also recognize the value of capital while simultaneously understanding that there‚Äôs no need for its owner (likely some beneficiary of primitive accumulation) to need to reap its return. This is my primary reason for believing that the above issues with Marx‚Äôs theory of value do not mitigate the analytical power of the rest of his theorizing. 

These thoughts come from my readings of a number of thinkers, both champions and critics of this theory of value, including: Karl Marx, Louis Althusser, Ernest Mandel, Robert Nozick, Milton Friedman, and Joseph   Schumpeter. At this time, my thoughts are rather incomplete and this is my first attempt to pull them together. 

The theory of value is critical to Marxian theory (so critical, in fact, that Marx begins Capital Vol 1 with it). It‚Äôs often misrepresented by critics, but does seem to have some legitimate shortcomings which I‚Äôve outlined here. I‚Äôm curious to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts.",Marx‚Äôs Theory of Value: Does it Hold Up,askphilosophy

193,"My (Brazilian) philosophy schoolbook says that the oriental counterparts of the classical Greeks were not ""properly philosophical"" because:

2: they didn't care about abstract reasoning, focusing on practical aspects of human behaviour.

And, the Wikipedia's page on Ekpyrosis says:

""A strong acceptance of¬†Aristotle's theories of the universe combined with a more practical lifestyle practiced by the Roman people, caused these later Stoics to focus their main effort on their own social well being on earth, and not on the cosmos.

A prime example of this is the prominent Stoic, Roman Emperor¬†Marcus Aurelius. In his personal writing¬†Meditations,¬†Marcus Aurelius chooses to discuss how one should act and live their life, rather than speculate on cosmological theories.""

So... My school textbook stablishes that one of the criteria that determines whether one is properly philosophical or not is worrying about abstract problems, with no direct relationship to practical matters, and this page on Wikipedia says that the Romans had ""a more practical lifestyle"".

198," Hey all! I'm taking a philosophy class and we're studying Leibniz' claim of the best of all possible worlds and only studied the first 13 sections of his discourse on metaphysics.

In section 13, where Leibniz talks about a proposition's necessity in God's perfect world being based on principles of contingency or of the existence of things out of a pool of equally possible things, is he saying that something is possible to occur in a different world both by, let's say, a person making a different choice than in God's most perfect world as well as that person not existing? So if I am destined to drive my car to work today in God's perfect world, is it possible that I don't drive my car today in a different world and also that, in an additional world that isn't chosen, I don't exist at all?

I've asked my professor and he said the interpretation is that it's only possible that there is a different outcome due to a world in which the person or thing doesn't exist. There's no world in which that person exists and chooses a completely different choice. I don't want to go against the grain with his interpretation nor fight the grade, I just want to understand, so I thought it'd, be best if I just moved the question to Reddit. I was so sure what I proposed was what Leibniz meant, that it could be either possibility.

Here is the specific passages that convinced me:

‚ÄúAnd (to repeat myself) although God is sure always to choose the best, that doesn‚Äôt stop something less perfect from being and remaining possible in itself, even though it won‚Äôt happen‚Äîfor what makes God reject it is its imperfection, not its being impossible‚Ä¶ All we need is to bear in mind that each such contingent proposition has reasons why it is so rather than otherwise‚Äîor (to put the same thing in other words), that there is an a priori proof of its truth which makes it certain, and which shows that the connection of its subject with its predicate has its foundation in the nature of each; but that this proof is not a demonstration of the proposition‚Äôs necessity, because those reasons ¬∑for its truth¬∑ are based only on the principle of contingency or of the existence of things, that is, on what is or what appears the best among a number of equally possible things.‚Äù",Leibniz' Best Possible Worlds,askphilosophy

This are his first works I have read aside from ‚ÄûMeaning and Reference‚Äú. 

Unfortunately, after his death, he couldn‚Äòt expand on what the relation between reference and truth exactly is and why reference excludes some kind of correspondence theory of truth to the referred external thing. If you happen to understand why he does this or if you would recommend me articles on this, I would be very grateful. Additionally, if you would recommend me discussions on Putnam‚Äòs interpretation of Alfred Tarski and if he is warranted in thinking that Tarski‚Äòs definition of truth doesn‚Äòt imply a correspondence theory of truth, I would be very grateful as well.

Because of Putnam‚Äòs semantic externalism and my previous research on Russell‚Äòs theory of description, I became interested on the philosophy of perception. His mind externalism as an objection to sense data theories of perception and that apperception that are conceptualized give us physical properties blew my mind.

206,"Kant refers to morality as an autonomy, accepting moral law for oneself and buy oneself on the basis of reason alone. he sets the philosophical emphasis in contradiction to even long-held ethical tradition that placed the highest value in the morals of the community. In kant's view the purpose of moral behavior is not utility but rationality itself in which freedom and autonomy are the key ingredients, having nothing to do with community. but does that go too far in the direction of freedom?

 why does he dismiss the positions of philosophers from Aristotle to Hume and even Hegel?
 could it be that the Kantian view of morality causes us to be devoid of ethos and attachment?

216,"If I understood correctly, Schopenhauer postulated the ""will"" as the Kantian thing-in-itself. The will is a blind striving. 

Freud suggested that pain is characterized by an increase in excitation, and pleasure is a removal of this excitation. Human beings are bound to the pleasure principle, or our ""will"". 

If you equate the will with all matter, or energy, could it be said that the will strives to decrease its energy? Basically, the will is to remove heat? 

If the will is this basic cause-and-effect, reflecting the thermodynamics of the physical world, could this be the ""essence"" of pleasure? A removal of energy? So take vacuum decay for instance, the metastable Higgs field decays into the true stable Higgs field. Would it be ""pleasurable"" for energy to do this?

Still, there are some patterns that seem to be part of any human morality : not making someone else suffer be it actively or passively, not hindering someone's possibility of happiness, etc. But even if those seem to be confirmed throughout history, this does not really prove that they should always be part of what is moral.

226,"And not just theists. A lot of people seem to think that the existence of God is not a scientific question. Well let's recall what the scientific method is. First you make and observation. Then you formulate a hypothesis to explain that observation. Then you make predictions based on that hypothesis. And then you test whether or not those predictions are accurate.

To say that a certain hypothesis is not a scientific hypothesis is to say that either the hypothesis wasn't formulated to explain an observation, or the hypothesis makes no predictions whatsoever, making it entirely inconsequential whether it is correct or not.

I doubt many theists would say that they propose the existence of God for no reason at all. Many of them say that they propose God as an explanation for fine-tuning, design, etc, which are observations. I also doubt that many theists would say that the existence of God is inconsequential.

So what gives? The existence of God seems like an entirely scientific question to me.

Here's a rebuttal that I sometimes hear: ""but God is immaterial. Science only deals with material entities"". This is false. Revisit the scientific method laid out above. There's *nothing* in it that prevents you from making a hypothesis about immaterial things.

233,"Hi all,

I am reading Albert Camus' the Myth of Sisyphus. I am at the section Absurd Freedom where he discusses the three consequences from the absurd (namely: revolt, freedom and passion).

I cannot wrap my head around the following passage where he discusses his second consequence:

&gt;""If I remain in that prearranged position which consists in drawing all the conclusions (and nothing else) involved in a newly discovered notion, I am faced with a second paradox."" In order to remain faithful to that method, I have nothing to do with the problem of metaphysical liberty. Knowing whether or not man is free doesn't interest me. I can experience only my own freedom.  As to it,  I can have no general notions, but merely a few clear insights. The problem of 'freedom as such' has no meaning. For it is linked in quite a different way with the problem of God"".

Here is my paraphrased interpretation: ""*If I can continue to draw conclusions from the absurd, I see a second paradox. (****What was the first paradox (absurd?)****?) To be consistent with the absurd, I cannot make a statement on anything that he cannot know, which includes metaphysical liberty (this really means free-will). He can only know what he experiences. Metaphysical liberty ('freedom as such') has no meaning in this context, because it is linked to the idea of God*"".

So far so good, I guess?

Here is where the struggle really begins:

&gt;""Knowing whether or not man is free involves knowing whether he can have a master. **The absurdity peculiar to this problem comes from the fact that the very notion that makes the problem of freedom possible also takes away all its meaning. For in the presence of God there is less a problem of freedom than a problem of evil. You know the alternative: either we are not free and God the all-powerful is responsible for evil. Or we are free and responsible but God is not all-powerful.** All the scholastic subtleties have neither added anything to nor subtracted anything from the acuteness of this paradox.""

My attempt at interpreting this: ""*If a man has a master, then he is not free. Otherwise, he is. But the paradox to this problem is that: what makes freedom possible also takes away its meaning (****why?****). In the presence of God, it's more a problem of evil than a problem of freedom. Why? If we are not free, then God is the all-powerful and also responsible for evil"", and if we are free, then we are responsible for evil and God is not all powerful. But God is powerful and herein lies the paradox*.""

I am not sure I am following this argument in particular. Could you help clarify these passages?

Only the latter requires ontological commitment to this thingamagick called ""possible worlds""; the former does not. In the absence of conclusive evidence for the existence of possible worlds, it seems to me justified to believe that all truths are (""deflationarily"") necessary until proven otherwise.

E.g. ""Charles Dodgson = Lewis Carroll"" (and 2+2=4) is necessary since it is true in virtue of the two names referring to one and the same object; not because Charles Dodgson = Lewis Carroll (and 2+2=4) is true in all possible worlds. ""Bob ate an apple at 7pm"" is necessary since it is true in virtue of...the simple fact that Bob ate an apple at 7pm...or perhaps...the fact that the event was necessarily caused by prior events up till the Big Bang which *necessarily* occurred (lest there arise insoluble problems to do with ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" and the fine-tuning problem, which arise because people tend to assume contingency, but do not arise, given necessity).

Of course people who are ignorant and not omniscient have the seeming or appearance of contingency, but I think those can be explained away in terms of ignorance (which we already know humans to possess in spades) rather than the extremely ontologically extravagant posit of possible worlds (whether that is cashed out in concrete terms, abstract terms or spooky Meinongian terms).","Could the world have been otherwise than it [simpliciter] is?

I am relatively new to philosophy. I wish that I had found it earlier as it could have exponentially improved my quality of life. As my understanding improves, I find myself trying to reconcile the views of the past with own personal beliefs in the hope of achieving better understanding, as is what I believe philosophy to be all about. 
My problem comes in the fact that anyone who thinks like this must have tons of thoughts and ideas.

Now I believe that the only thing that we can do if value in this life is try to improve ourselves through understanding.

11,"this is an answer a classmate sent me, but I don't understand anything from the second paragraph onwards:

Intentionalism and the transparency thesis are two approaches to the question of whether intentionality is always directed toward an object. This picks up on the fact that many experiences or moods, such as pain, nausea, anxiety, depression, and boredom, are not object-directed.

While the narrow conception of intentionality means that intentionality is always (only) object-hood, the broad conception of intentionality includes everything that is not the subject, so intentionality is the openness of awareness of something or even world-hood.

Intentionalism/ modern representation thesis (MR), in contrast to image theory, holds that consciousness is completely exhausted by representational content (Exhaustion Thesis: the phenomenal character of a state is nothing other than its content, it does not go beyond it). From this follows transparency of consciousness (""phenomenology ain't in the head"" Tye). The qualitative character consists exclusively in the qualitative properties that objects have. Experiences acquire their phenomenal character simply through the representation of the external world. As a result, all phenomenal properties are representational as such. There are no non-intentional experiences.

Consciousness is thus empty and nothing but intentional givenness.",What is the transparency thesis/theory and how does it relate to intentionalism?,askphilosophy

I study Humanities studies focused on philosophy and for the philosophy modul I will be writing my bachelor-thesis. Necessary to say It will be written in Czech language.

However at this point - to what extent is it just an abstract reflection or something that can be somehow substantiated (meaning; based on a book that was written by somebody ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù). Because there can‚Äôt be any empiristic experience with the ‚Äúafter‚Äù-life, although there can be let‚Äôs say empiric experience of the death of the other.
Is it possible to somehow take the concept of nothingness from the Science of logic let‚Äôs say, and use it in this case?

Next I thought of Heidegger‚Äôs being-towards-death concept and the implementation to the thesis. I still haven‚Äôt finished Being and time, but is there any concept of death of dasein - when its ‚Äúremoved‚Äù from the world?

I was as well advised to read Being and nothingness (haven‚Äôt started yet). Other tips were Levinas, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer‚Ä¶?

33,"Quoth Michael A. Aquino's introduction to the *Satanic Bible*:

&gt; Each successive era of man‚Äôs cultural and ethical development has upraised its literarymanifesto - an argument challenging existing norms and proposing a novel approach to theenduring issues of civilization. It has not infrequently been the case that the realities of political nationalism have been blended with the idealisms of extranational emphasis to produce what wenow cautiously term existentialism. Pertinent works might include the Republic of Plato, the Politics of Aristotle, Machiavelli‚Äôs Prince, and the writings of Nietzsche, Hobbes, Locke, Marx,and Sartre.

Now, Aquino is a political scientist, so I'm a bit caution to dismiss this as the gibberish of the prima facie. But I'm pretty bewildered. Does it make sense to say that existentialism is a blend, in any way (and in what?) of ""the realities of political nationalism"" with ""idealism of extranational emphasis""? Are the *Republic* and *Il Principe* works of Existentialism? It certainly doesn't fit the period, but that doesn't mean there can't be a thematic connection. Nietzsche perhaps makes sense in the context, and Sartre is indubitable, but how are Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke and Marx existentialists? Is there a secondary meaning to the word ""existentialism"", perhaps in pol.sci. or pol.phi. under which it makes sense to classify these works as existentialist?

The perhaps more hard-to-tackle question would be, even if none of the questionable authors and works are ""existentialist"" in any non-idiolectical meaning of the word, do any of them (in what way?) do something that ""blended"" ""the realities of political nationalism with the idealisms of extranational emphasis""? Machiavelli and Plato aren't concerned with international order and seem to be international only in the presumed universality of their analysis, Marx seems to be concerned with the nation only insofar as he predicts and promulgates its abolition. I'm not familiar enough with the other authors to even consider whether the statement could make sense (and perhaps I'm not familiar enough with the aforementioned either).

Nowadays, there is no unanimity whatever on this point. Some philosophers call metaphysics a such and such delineated area of (conceptual) science. In view of the fact that this word, through its historical past, contains for many a suggestion of the vague and speculative, it would be more appropriate not to call such areas of philosophy which are to be treated with strict scientific concepts ""metaphysics"". If what is in question is basic knowledge (in the sense of logical, experiential, constructional order), then the name ""basic science"" could be used. If we are concerned with the ultimate, most general knowledge, the name ""cosmology"" or a similar one could be employed.

98,"Hi all, first post here! 

I‚Äôm 24m, and am on the tail end of a much-needed, deeply cathartic existential crisis. The beginning of the pandemic coincided with a bad breakup, moving back with my parents after university, and the inevitable growth of my prefrontal cortex, and let‚Äôs just say I was in a really dark place for about 1.5 years. 

I‚Äôve been given the opportunity and privilege to systematically examine and deconstruct nearly every part of myself and the world around me. As I‚Äôm sure many of you can relate, it was horrifying at first, but soon became exhilarating. I had next to zero philosophy background prior to this phase of my life, apart from my religious upbringing, which I‚Äôve also come to peace with. In fact, I feel like I‚Äôve come to a very good place both cognitively and spiritually over the past 2 years. 

I‚Äôve read probably 50 books since this whole ordeal started, and I‚Äôve engaged in countless powerful and moving dialogues with people from various backgrounds , perspectives, and schools of thought. I‚Äôve even explored some eastern religion and new-age spirituality, and have found ways to beautifully integrate a lot of this knowledge into my schemas. I don‚Äôt feel like I have all the answers. In fact, I am not more comfortable than ever with not having the answers I though I would discover through the pursuit of an examined life. That being said, I am so much wiser that I was, and have gained the ability to articulate my thoughts in a much clearer way than I ever have before. Obviously, I‚Äôve had my moments of existential horror, deep depression, and an encounter with the proverbial void, but I‚Äôve come out on the other side a better man.

Here‚Äôs my issue: I can‚Äôt turn it off. 

I‚Äôve come to a place, philosophically, where I feel like the intuitive next step is to go from doctrine to praxis, and I am REALLY struggling. I‚Äôve spent so much time analyzing and parsing apart the world that I‚Äôm finding it near impossible to get out of my head and into the world. I‚Äôve spent so much time thinking that I‚Äôve forgot how to LIVE. I am, by nature, a really warm and welcoming person, and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm losing the ability to relate to people in an empathetic way. I believe the most important part of self-examination is the inevitable return to the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù and the application of these new ideas, but I find myself lost in thought or analysis way more often than I would like to. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt control when I want to philosophize anymore. I‚Äôm locked in this weird cognitive defense mechanism.

Long story short, I‚Äôm getting really worried that I can‚Äôt snap out of this hyper-philosophical state. It‚Äôs beginning to affect my relationships, my day-to-day wellbeing, and it is preventing me from enjoying my life. The irony is, that my personal philosophies account for this, and I know rationally how to break out of it, but a big part of me refuses to let go of the constant analysis.

Experts agree that it has no official definition, which means there is no demarcation between what is (or what is not) metaphysics.

It often rejects empiricism, which means it literally treats philosophers as clairvoyant psychics who can divine raw facts about the universe using naught but the power of thought.

Fast forward to today, and I'm finally starting to get invested more seriously in learning about philosophy. There's just one problem.

124," I see how the fact of categories structuring our perception means they must universally obtain in the world of appearances, since appearances could not arise in the first place without interfacing with our faculty of perception. However, I do not see how this gets us past even Cartesian doubt, since there is, as far as I can tell, no justification offered for believing that such appearances occur after all, besides our recollection of them after the fact. I suppose you could appeal to appearances of the present moment, but by the time you're introspecting about them, they're already memories, and even if they weren't, you cannot be certain that they are structured by the same perceptual categories as past appearances or as future appearances will be.

Also, as a second point, even if this problem were to be somehow resolved, it is not at all clear how the universality of these phenomenological categories allows us to acquire knowledge about the phenomenal world besides the mere fact of its being structured according to these perceptual categories.

I can see how one might try to make a case from the causal structure of perception that we can know from direct perception what caused what, but it does not seem to follow in any obvious sense why the laws of causality should be regular and uniform. That is, it does not seem to follow why the same cause cannot have vastly different effects on different occasions. One day, you might strike a tree with an axe and cut it down, another day, the tree might turn into a rubber duck from being struck with the axe. I can imagine perceiving this without apparently violating any of the innate categories structuring my faculty of perception.

A second problem is this: My perception does not actually seem to be structured in causes and effects. I am still trying to ascertain whether others are simply mischaracterising their own perception, or whether my faculty of perception is genuinely unusual. I simply observe a kind of ubiquitous continuity through time which I attribute to determinism, but this only as an empirical and uncertain estimate of what might give rise to the apparent continuity I perceive. I only divide things into discrete causes and effects at the level of concepts, not percepts, which I do in order to evaluate the outcomes of counterfactual scenarios for the purpose of acting in the world.

Let‚Äòs say we accept that the universe had a cause. Craig then proceeds to argue that the cause must have caused all of space, time and matter and must therefore be immaterial, space- and timeless. The only plausible answer he says is that a conscious being must be the cause.
But.
Next to space, time and matter, consciousness is also a part of the universe and reality. Conscious creatures exist, consciousness is a part of the universe and therefore we could conclude that the cause of the universe cannot be conscious. 
Otherwise there is no reason why the cause could not also be in time, space and consist of matter. 
If the cause brings into existence everything that exists, which includes consciousness, then consciousness cannot be part of the cause, because then it wouldn‚Äôt be creatio ex nihilo.

I‚Äôm always moving towards something, advancing towards my goal with each workout in which I partake. With that advancement comes the joys and satisfaction of achievement. Weather I reach this goal or not is redundant; for all my efforts will prepare me for whatever next desire I designate as something worthy of duty and by proxy a routine

I am a simple man

I have no enemies 

I have no true genuine desire for social fulfillment nor material wealth

There is no room for stress and negativity. 

I have nothing I consider bullshit in my life. 

Everything is a means to peaceful, unhinged serenity.

Attitude is the key for an untroubled existence; As for what I give out to life (for it‚Äôs one of the few rules of the universe) I will correspondingly receive back. There will be times in which things beyond my control will push me around and set me off course but I am responsible for my attitude no matter the scenario. Those who have achieved their serenity, goals, and general successes have a good attitude towards life. Those who are depressed, fail, and are lazy have a negative/bad attitude towards life. Attitude is a true reflection of the self and will determine your state of mind and being.

Everybody has different things they want to achieve and different ways in which they want to achieve it. It solely depends on what experiences you‚Äôve underwent as an individual . Do not assume anything is uniformed ; for it will only lead to misunderstandings and confusion. See people for who they truly are instead of just looking at their actions. Judge the causes of a humans actions instead of the effects.

He pointed out that in the original Hebrew the commandment actually reads ""thou shall not murder"". Regardless of the original text, I was taught that it was ""Thou shall not kill"" and in the end prefer that interpretation.

That interpretation, however, does present challenges. What do we do in situations when someone kills in self defense or in battle? We routinely slaughter animals for meat. If one is an advocate for the 6th commandment, must one become a pacifist vegan who argues that the police should be disarmed? Or just live in hypocrisy?

I myself see the act of killing as simply wrong, but condoned when necessary. It is not something to be done lightly. That is why societies have all kinds of laws and codes and so forth surrounding it, but in the end it is still tolerated in many cases. I wonder if the move from the word ""murder"" to the word ""kill"" happened as man became more civilized and as societies progressed to have dedicated armies, police forces, and butchers, which allow for the majority of us to have no need to kill-basically live by the commandment.

From looking at the truth table for a conditional, this argument is valid as there is only one row in the truth table for a conditional where all the premises are true and it happens to be that the conditional is also true.

The question that jumps out at me is that if the definition of validity is that an argument is valid iff if the premises are all true, then the conclusion is true, then we could have an invalid argument where all the premises are true and the conclusion is true, and it would be considered valid. In other words:

P = all the premises are true

In [this debate](https://youtu.be/1n-zYRZy5NQ?t=1612) (skip to 26:52) he implies very heavily that the reason why anything made of parts must be contingent is that being made of parts means that the universe could have been re-arranged.

149,"If one assumes/believes that at this point, global warming along with the unbelievably unsustainable global system we've created will eventually cause what one might call ""societal collapse"", would it be ethical to try to prolong the inevitable, specifically by working in fossil fuels (exploration, refining, etc.), such that the ""good times"" are longer than they otherwise would have been?

For this thought experiment (if you could call it that), I want to assume that

1) there are no energy alternatives that can feasibly satisfy anything close to what global demand has been for the past decades, or for a global population of 8 billion humans, even at minimal energy use per person.

2) due to the (ever increasing) pressures of global warming (I don't think the specific causes are relevant for this question), there is a near guarantee of something like global societal collapse (think massive population reduction, industrial and telecom failure, breadbasket failure, near-zero/zero fossil fuel production aka no transportation, massive migration, etc.), perhaps over a few decades, to occur sometime in the future. Lets say within 250 years, although I'm not sure that matters much given the assumption of inevitability.

3) working in fossil fuels / hydrocarbons is a direct cause of the predicament we are in, by making such global industrialization possible and by being the primary contributor to greenhouse gasses, which force global warming.

4) by working to expand/increase hydrocarbon extraction/production, one does not significantly contribute to population increase, and therefore does not increase the number of beings that will suffer (in varied ways of course) from such collapse. I think this assumption is fair for my question because although population does increase as a result of increased energy availability (basically), standards of living have increased significantly across the board (basically) despite exploding population.

5) by working in fossil fuels, the majority of one's impact is a marginal increase in the amount of time that global human population gets to persist in the current system of relentless energy consumption and growth, and immense wealth and comfort (obviously not for all, but still for many, including everyone who is reading this on a screen of some sort).

I may want to update with another premise but that's all I have right now. Of course you could deny of these premises and I definitely don't agree with all of them.

Propositions 8. and 9. are very much statements of the Principle of Identity of Indescernibles:

Proposition 8:,,Yet the Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ in quality, there would be absolutely no means of perceiving any change in things. For what is in the compound can come only from the simple elements it contains, and the Monads, if they had no qualities, would be indistinguishable from one another , since they do not differ in quantity. Consequently, space being a plenum, each part of space would always receive, in any motion, exactly the equivalent of what it already had, and no one state of things would be discernible from another.

Proposition 9: ,,Indeed, each Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an intrinsic quality [denomination].‚Äù

My question: Does IOI apply only to our world or is it necessary principle in every possible world? Is Leibniz in his Monadologydescribing only this world or is he arguing that in whatever world there could be, there has to be different Monads? I simply do not see why it should be necessary for there to be this difference between Monads, that is why should POI apply for all possible world?

Does anyone have any resources discussing the ethics of gentrification? During the pandemic, remote work became a lot more common.

I have several friends who are ""digital nomads"" who live in different locations across the world for short periods of time. This lifestyle is really appealing to me, but I'm concerned about the ethics of living nomadically in different parts of the world which live on much lower standards of living. Living in these places by renting airbnbs or renting apartments at prices that are not affordable to locals raises their cost of living.

There was no perception at the Big bang or during the formation of the earth and evolution etc. This leads to the ""proof of God"" that there must be an eternal mind that is always perceiving everything.

I'm not saying I believe this argument, but it has never been refuted since George Berkeley thought of it.

He says that desire or the action urging process can be just like the idea of the pleasure of the action or whatever. For example, let's say the simple action of taking a shower or something. I would say that the motivation for this action would be like a frustration and the longer you dont take a shower the more potent the frustration grows. Now he would say that it could be like the idea of the hot water or just the overall pleasure of the shower that could motivate you. My counter to this would be that when comparing both states, the state of the non-shower and the state of taking the shower, one would be better and one would be worse in comparison to the other and so you would need like like a frustration or something to motivate you to go to the other state. If not, then both states would be fine and you would be satisfied with either. To note, we both agree that human desire is frustration, but we disagree on whether this is binded to desire or not.

201," Just by way of clarification and motivation: it can seem like there are times where we have to think certain thoughts if we are to properly understand what we're talking about, where we may have to extend beyond the limits of the sensible (in the sense of sensation) in order to see where certain concepts go (and here I have Kant in mind! But you might also think of any positivistic approach to Philosophy centered on sensory posits with some set of standards of rules or restrictions), and especially where this might lead our inquiry into a sort of domain of an analysis of essences, or of wholes, or of any other sort of concept that does not lend itself to a good old fashioned empirical treatment. Now if we end up in this domain, it can be tempting to label these kinds of thoughts as nonsense (again thinking of Kant) insofar as they might put us in a position of attempting to make judgments about things for which there is no possibility of experiencing them or any object related to them in experience. Carnap might say we should render these kinds of ideas or thoughts in poetry, perhaps, and so on - there is just nothing to which they could correspond in experience and so, if this is criterial for sense-making, they're really just nonsense. 

And yet, and here is what seems odd to me, and this connects back to the start of the post: it can seem like it would not be rational to not follow these threads through insofar as thought is leading us somewhere with them - they can even be illuminating to how we understand various concepts by extending them into more abstract cases or toy models that may not have any connection to experience or even to anything possible for us to experience. There are of course many kinds of thinking (including Philosophy itself) that can possess this feature. And just as way of more motivation: if we were to imagine someone who was trying to never think such thoughts and only allowed themselves to consider thoughts in a positivistic fashion such that they are only ever thinking about what has been impressed upon their minds by the sensory world, and so restricting themselves to that domain (perhaps with various positive benefits even for them in their behavior, only thinking what is directly revealed by the senses, acting in what is often conceived of as a purely rational and sensible manner, restricted to the sensory world, only moving on the basis of such sensorily based judgments, and so on - sometimes we use rational in this way), I feel like this would induce a kind of collapse in thinking itself, because it would close off all kinds of speculative inquiry and questioning and a variety of processes that are rational in their own right, that designate *appropriate* routes of thinking in some sense, and that can reveal other kinds of angles on our concepts, that, to use a bit of poetic talk (perhaps), reveal more of the *logos* and so are rational in some sense.

And so there's this kind of rational process that can appear like nonsense such that a great many figures in the history of Philosophy would consider it so, and yet it also likewise does not appear to be irrational - it really looks like rational nonsense, but maybe that's also just what Philosophy itself is - so much rational nonsense... 

Anyway that's what motivated this question: it seems odd that for a huge amount of Philosophy, there ought to be vast swathes of thinking that count as rational nonsense, but you never see that phrase (a google search result gave me basically nothing - I'd have to dig harder, but all the results seemed connected to the phrase ""anti-rational nonsense"" which is much less surprising, or else ""rational nonsense"" was used in a sarcastic manner.) I also realize that this is probably less of a problem for us nowadays since there's such a low threshold for what counts as sense-making nowadays after the collapse of logical positivism. If it's at least not analytically false, it's at least sensible, right? Too loose, but maybe more correct than our forebears...",Is there room in Philosophy for a category of rational nonsense?,askphilosophy
202,"I've seen David Benatar's Asymmetry Argument described as being based on intuition, for example in Elizabeth Harman's critique. One of the examples she gives (not sure if this is from Benatar or just her example):

&gt;Suppose a woman has a temporary condition such that if she conceives now, she will have a child who will have a congenital disease that will cause some suffering and death around the age of forty. Suppose that if she waits and conceives later, she will have an ordinary healthy child. It is generally agreed that she should wait, but there is a problem in explaining why

She goes on to say that Benetar resolves this problem by concluding that normal procreation is wrong.

My question is: It seems that an appeal to intuition (""It is generally agreed..."") is relied on to establish this as a problem. But if we are to give weight to common intuitions, then why not give *more* weight to what must be one of the most common intuitions of all: That normal procreation is good?

I‚Äôm looking for advice on what to study next.

I‚Äôm fascinated by the way the various arts interrelate, and by how philosophy pervades all of them. I want to study the consequences of ideology. I‚Äôm considering a Masters in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, but to be honest even that does not seem broad or fundamental enough ‚Äì the coursework seems more like a technical education in preparation for a career in public policy. What I‚Äôm really looking for is a base of knowledge that will allow me to explain various views within all the arts (political theory, economic theory, psychology, sociology, music, art, architecture, history, literature, etc.) through the lens of philosophy. A classic history of philosophy courseload just doesn‚Äôt delve deep enough into this in my opinion. I want to know how one‚Äôs metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology will tend to push that individual to a particular interpretation of the other arts.

For example, we can clearly speak of Marxist politics and economics, but we can also speak of Marxist architecture (Brutalism?), Marxist history (Class oppression created the world around us?), and so on. Marxism itself, I‚Äôm sure, is naturally aligned with a certain metaphysic (scientific materialism?), ethic (Social Darwinism? Nihilism? I don‚Äôt know), and epistemology (?). Okay, this is pretty easy with Marxism and its associated philosophical underpinnings since it‚Äôs so popular. But what about the consequences of accepting one of the other top 20 or 30 theories within the main branches of philosophy across the history of philosophy? This is what I want to know.

I‚Äôm less interested in the debates themselves within the main branches of philosophy about whose theory is right, and more interested in the consequences of one‚Äôs positions on those debates ‚Äì the consequences in the external world, as well as the consequences within the mind.

217,"Hello there,

I have a question but first I have to explain my general idea.

I've been entertaining the idea that we, humans, are most comfortable in the absence of ourselves. And by that I mean the absence of self-reflection. We experience this absence only when we exist intuitively ""in the moment"", which is why we seek to place ourselves in situations like these that demand our presence outside of ourselves, immediately. This could be sports, art, entertainment, taking hikes, having conversations etc. ... 

In my current definition of escapism I define all these as such, in as much as we do them to get away from ""ourselves"" and our own thoughts. The reason why we enjoy playing basketball is because there is simply no time to think. The situation demands that you do not think but act. If you think, you act too slow, and then you lose the game.

So the idea is that we are comfortable when we are *present in the situation* = being *absent from ourselves*. 

I'm in the research phase for a lengthy philosophy paper that I am about to write, possibly about this. **So the question is**, I hope it's okay to ask here, what philosophy has been done that leans towards (or against) this? What philosophers would be interesting to read in order to delve deeper into this? I considered the French existentialists like Sartre and Camus, but if anyone has knowledge of specific works that might relate to this, it would be very helpful.

With the exception of  G√∂del's Incompleteness Theorems (which I think count as Analytic, and were also transformative for me), it seems like all the interesting philosophical questions are out of reach of the analytic method. Consider Marx's take on utilitarianism:

&gt; The apparent absurdity of merging all the manifold relationships of people in the one relation of usefulness, this apparently metaphysical abstraction arises from the fact that in modern bourgeois society all relations are subordinate in practice to the one abstract monetary commercial relation. 

I mean, I consider this critique to be quite scathing, once fully unpacked. It's not even, strictly speaking, just philosophical - it merges philosophy, history, psychology, etc. And the analytic method, it seems, doesn't even have a way to respond!

In spite of this, I obviously don't want to be dismissive of philosophy, and I want to be fair and open. Therefore I ask for readings that will (hopefully) restore my respect for the analytic style.

I am someone who's not good at philosophy so if I will phrase anything incorrectly I would be glad if you told me so that I could clarify.

This being said, the given question has lately been tormenting me: almost everyone seem to take the relevance of propriety, decency, decorum, or however you want to call it for granted, but I have yet to find an explanation on why it is the case.

Everything I read, when the ""why part"" was not snobbed, only gave practical reasons such as ""because at a work interview it increases your chances of getting the job"" or ""it is more good looking"".

What I am asking is, and I feel like stating that I am too among those persons who recognise the importance of decorum, is there a logical philosophical explanation?

248,"Looking back from the present, it can be difficult to understand the stakes in old mathematical and scientific debates. From our perspective, Newtonianism seems like a natural evolution of Cartesianism after mixing with some British empiricism. But when you look back at contemporary accounts, we often see nothing but dogmatic, fierce and personal debates. Sometimes, like in the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence, they even get theological. It took Voltaire and company more than a decade of polemics to finally ""overcome"" the inertia of Descartes in French intellectual circles. Point being, they mattered deeply, and I don't feel comfortable dismissing the conflict on petty grounds. So why where they so rancorous? What exactly was going on, and what was at stake?
 
I'll try to give a brief synopsis of the history as I understand it. Rationalism, empiricism, Newtonianism, etc., are (often vague) intellectual movements generally billed as a revolt against the Aristotelian-Scholastic understanding of the world. The Early Modern thinkers wanted to uncover the secrets of nature. For example, when Marin Mersenne wrote to Ren√© Descartes in 1638 to inquire about a rumor, that Descartes was ""giving up"" mathematics, Descartes replied:

&gt;I have only resolved to give up abstract geometry, that is to say, research into questions which serve only to exercise the mind; and I am doing this in order to have more time to cultivate another sort of geometry, which takes as its questions the explanation of the phenomena of nature.

This was written around the time Descartes had just finished *Discourse on the Method*, where Descartes not only lays out the perennial *cogito ergo sum*, but also reveals a new way of performing mathematics: analytic geometry. Despite its abstraction, Descartes believed that his new mathematical creation was not a mere exercise of the mind, like how the Greeks often treated geometry, but rather special insight into the mechanics of nature and how the world worked. Descartes's analytic geometry traveled from France to prime Newton and Leibniz's discovery of calculus. Then Newton famously used calculus to describe, but not explain (irritatingly to many, especially Leibniz), gravity and the laws of motion, famously quipping that he posited ""no hypotheses."" Newton and Leibniz clashed on the issue, seeing the issue of God at stake as both were deeply religious individuals, with Newton's views largely coming out on top after the Clarke-Leibniz correspondence in 1715-1716. Finally, the secular-minded Voltaire began to ferry Newton's ideas back into France in the early 18th century, where he battled with the calcified Cartesian intellectual establishment until Newtonianism won out. 

So, why do these views on science and mathematics end up being so deeply entrenched in metaphysical and even religious beliefs when the connection is not obvious? I reckon that Newton would have rolled in his grave if he saw what Voltaire did with his work. Maybe even Descartes would have looked askew at Newton a bit if he knew *exactly* the kind of personal religious symbolism that Newton put into his work.","What is Newtonian-ism, how is it different from Cartesian-ism, and why was Voltaire so enamored by the former?",askphilosophy

There are \*many\* types of logic and mathematics.  
All formal systems (logic, math, etc) follow patterns, rules.  
Sometimes they contradict other logics.  
For example, non-classical logics has certain rules that would fundamentally be incompatible with other logic systems.  
Of course, I know that, it is \*us\*, humans, who decide on certain rules and then follow them.  
I understand that rules of logic are abstract objects, relationships, systems, structures, however one would call them, we construct them as arbitrarily as we want them.  
But apparently, not too arbitrarily, as they have to have a consistent utility/output (I think?).  
I vaguely feel there's something special about logic, that is different than other human mental constructs.  
For example, in logic, there is a popular phrase, ""you cannot make an argument against the validity of arguments"".  
No matter how you slice it, I doubt anyone can work against this in any meaningful capacity, there's \*something\* in the background that is more fundamental, deeper, it's not as arbitrary/random as some people make it out to be, it's not ""just another language lol"".

He goes on to argue that God cannot predict what people will do because free will and reason are powers God delegated to people at His expense. Furthermore, Pinnock states that God, if all-powerful, could certainly create a world in which they are not in control of everything, making themselves vulnerable.

However, this got me wondering if it is truly possible for an all-powerful being to be anything but all-powerful, having their influence stretch everywhere to everything. If we assume that God delegates limited power to man, God would still have infinite power because a fraction of infinity is still infinity. So if God has infinite power always, it seems impossible to create beings limited in power--such as man--that would be able to contest Him or be unpredictable.

Of course, the range of belief is very wide within each subfield. But are there any views that reign over others that may give a clue to how each subfield views these concepts differently?

Additionally, what I‚Äôve seen, among philosophers that specialize in non-political fields, is that support for communitarian, egalitarian, and anarchist thought is quite common. 

However, I find that, at least through my current studies in University as a political science major, the bend is commonly toward a slightly left liberal leaning. Rarely further left, though even rarer to go further right. I do find that further left wing thought is more common among 1800-early 1900s philosophers than those of today, though. I‚Äôve yet to take a course focused on political theory or political philosophy. Most of my courses have been either political or philosophical. So my assumption here is restricted to my studies in international relations, law, comparative politics, and public policy.

Certain subfields, usually ones that are more focused on sociology, seem to accept more left wing thought. Outside of that, it seems to largely be within the spectrum of liberal to social democratic. I see even less going further to the right, outside of libertarian right thought.

My assumption is that, if I am accurate in viewing it this way, the difference lies in a combination of self-selection and the effects that different specializations within philosophy have on what assumptions are accepted by the individual and what factors they find to be the most important. It‚Äôs also possible that earlier philosophers had varied beliefs between each subfield and later philosophers are more likely to come across the arguments of those within their subfield.

I might be reading this all wrong. And I certainly could have bias from what the professors Ive had until now have shown me. 

Is my view here accurate? If so, why might this be? Or, if not, what have I missed in my analysis?

There are a lot of details and I can't summarize everything or explain it as well as he does but an approximate resume is: things must have a cause other than themselves (a mother birthing herself is illogical), and things can't come from nothing for the same reason. He attacks the position that the universe made itself or it came from nothing which many people can agree with, but the biggest points are against the belief that the universe ""is"" or has always been.

Things cannot come from infinite contingents connections so things must have a first cause, since **everything** is both make-able and destructible nothing else can't be necessary as it arises dependence to exist, and universe as contains everything can't be necessary because as infinite regress isn't real it had to create something at one point: creating from nothing.

Since God is external to the universe is the only one who can cause the universe and everything else without breaking this logic. Because sets of contingency are used, it's **mathematically** proven that God exists.

58,"&gt;I mean 'unfree will', which amounts to an abuse of cause and effect. One ought not to make 'cause' and 'effect' into material things, as natural scientists do (and those who, like them, naturalize in their thinking - ), in accordance with the prevailing mech anistic stupidity which has the cause press and push until it 'produces an effect'; one ought to employ 'cause' and 'effect' only as pure concepts, that is to say as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation, mutual understanding, not explana tion. In the 'in itself' there is nothing of 'causal connection', of 'necessity', of 'psychological unfreedom'; there 'the effect' does not 'follow the cause', there no 'law' rules. It is we alone who have fabricated causes, succession, reciprocity, relativity, compulsion, number, law, freedom, motive, purpose; and when we falsely introduce this world of symbols into things and mingle it with them as though this symbol-world were an 'in itself', we once more behave as we have always behaved, namely mythologically. 'Unfree will' is mythology: in real life it is only a question of strong and weak wills. - It is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself when a thinker detects in every 'causal connection' and 'psychological neces sity' something of compulsion, exigency, constraint, pressure, unfreedom: such feelings are traitors, the person who has them gives himself away. And, if I have observed 'unfreedom of will' is in general conceived as a problem from two completely antithetical standpoints but always in a pro foundly personal manner: one will at no price give up his 'responsibility', his belief in himself, the personal right to bis deserts (the vain races belong here), the other, on the contrary, will not be responsible for anything, to blame for anything, and out of an inner self-contempt wants to be able to shift off his responsibility for himself somewhere else. This latter, when he writes books, tends today to espouse the cause of the criminal; his most pleasing disguise is a kind of socialist sympathy. And the fatalism of the weak-willed is indeed beautified to an astonishing degree when it can present itself as 'la religion de la souffrance humaine': that is its 'good taste'.",can someone explain what does nietzsche mean in this?,askphilosophy

66,"I don't read or indulge in a lot of philosophical texts. While reading On Beauty by Umberto Eco he cites Hegel talking about the representation of suffering. he cites, 

""The true critical point in this life of God is the one in which he abandons his individual existence as this man, the Passion, suffering on the cross, the Calvary of the spirit, the torments of death. Now, insofar as here it is implicit in the content itself that corporeal, outward appearance, immediate existence as an individual, is revealed by the pain of its own negativity as the negative, so that the spirit may attain its own truth and its own heaven through the sacrifice of the sensible and of subjective singularity, this sphere of representation is more detached than any other from the classical plastic ideal.

In fact, on the one hand, the earthly body and the fragility of human nature are generally elevated and honoured for the fact that it is God himself that appears in them; on the other hand, however, it is precisely this humanity and corporeity that is posited as a negative and appears through suffering, while in the classical ideal it loses none of its undisturbed harmony with the spiritual and the substantial. The forms of Greek Beauty cannot be used to portray the flagellation of Christ, crowned with thorns, dragging the cross to the appointed place of torment, crucified and dying amid the torments of a long and martyred agony.

But the superiority of these situations is given by sanctity in itself, by the profundity of the intimate, by the infinity of suffering as an eternal moment of the spirit, and by the divine calm and resignation.

Around this figure stand the circle both of friends and enemies. Not even the friends are ideals, but, according to the concept, particular individuals, ordinary men led to Christ by the impulses of the spirit; but the enemies, insofar as they are opposed to God, condemn, mock, martyr and crucify him, are represented as wicked inside, and the representation of inner wickedness and hostility toward God brings in its train outer ugliness, coarseness, barbarity, rage and the deformation of the figure. In all these regards the non-beautiful is represented here as a necessary phase, which is not the case with classical [concepts of] Beauty.''

I‚Äôm looking for a ethical framework that matches my particular moral intuition. Can you please guide me as which theories and thinkers best match what I might have in mind?

I figured out that If I‚Äôm ever tempted by a moral transgression (riding a bus without a ticket, leaving trash on a beach when finding a trashcan is incovenient) I usually think what would happen to the society when this transgression is normalized and treated as normal.

From what I understand that is close to either cathegorical imperative or rule utilitarnianism but the examples and thought experiments given in noob-friedly descriptions of these ideas do not satisfy me.

For example ‚Äúlying is always wrong‚Äù does not take into consideration the variety and ‚Äúshades‚Äù of lies there are. I would greatly prefer if friends would not lie to each other on important issues while it‚Äôs perfectly fine to me if people prefer to not tell the truth if a friend asks them if they like their new hairstyle or pants. The first example would ruin our society while the second arguably makes it better. I‚Äôm fine with targeting and killing terrorists or hostage takers but I don‚Äôt accept murder of someone for financial gain or hate etc.

The focus in examples given in wikipedia articles or simplified explanations of various moral frameworks leads me to either accepting or denying possibility of ‚Äúlying‚Äù or ‚Äútaking someones life‚Äù whereas my intuitions depend on a context.

83,"As of 2021, in the U.S. there were movements centered around recognizing animals as legal persons [1], and several countries in Europe now have minor parties centered around animal rights. These political activities will probably spur to a philosophical re-evaluation of the law and ethics surrounding the death penalty and how it applies to non-humans, something that is very relevant for most domesticated species; as of 2022, a majority of pigs, cattle, and chicken can expect to be killed (or, if we want to use a possible future terminology, executed) by humans.
For instance, going by 2016 statistics, 1,500,000,000 pigs are executed globally each year [2]. Amnesty estimates 483 executions of humans in 2020 [3], which means that for every human executed, around 3 million pigs were executed.
To my knowledge none of these 1,500,000,000 pigs have a lawyer, none of them have a right to a trial, and none of them have been convicted of any crime. This is essentially 1,500,000,000 extrajudicial killings (though not yet recognized as such), but by legalizing the death penalty for pigs, humans could establish a legal precedent and judicial procedure for rightfully executing them.
A philosophical and ethical expansion of the death penalty would be the first step to consider, since common conceptions about justice are one of the sources for laws. If this is accepted, next to follow in practice is the  legal extension of the death penalty. What are your thoughts on this?

99,"Recently, I've been digesting Plato's dialogues and Aristotle's practical works, but I've been struggling to fully understand the vocabulary that they were working with. Normally, I see *episteme*, *nous*, and *sophia* translated as science, intellect, and (theoretical) wisdom respectively. Science is given the definition of ""justified true belief"" (with reservations) in Plato's *Theaetetus*. And I've seen intellect described as ""first principles"", with (theoretical) wisdom seen as something that combines science and intellect together. At a first glance, this seems reasonable. But after a closer look, I think there's clearly something missing in translation.

First of all, science must have meant something different to the Greeks than we typically understand it today, no? And I remember seeing *episteme* associated with **both** *dianoia* (demonstration) and *noesis* (discursion) in the Divided Line analogy of *The Republic*. If *episteme* is tied to knowledge of the eternal forms, then it might be distant from ""science"" as the empirically-driven, always-changing body of knowledge as we would understand it today. Perhaps it meant ""science"" in the old fashioned sense, meaning ""knowing and studying things."" Aristotle may have taken *episteme* to be more empirically-driven, given his own way of doing things, too. In any case, I'm not quite sure. 

Secondly, *episteme* defined as ""justified true belief"" seems similar to *logos*. *Logos* also has a wide variety of connotations, both within Plato's work (being the ""intelligent"" part of the tripartite soul) and in Ancient Greek (meaning speech, thought, computation, narrative, etc.). Yet in Plato's *Seventh Letter*, we have five kinds of knowledge listed: name, *logos*, image, *episteme*, and the mystical ""fifth."" So, in Plato's eyes, *logos* and *episteme* must be distinct from each other, but I'm not exactly sure how. For Plato, does *episteme* include *logos* along with something else? 

Then there is the question of *nous*. When *nous* is described as ""first principles"", especially by Aristotle, what kind of first principles is he talking about? Is he talking about Plato and his ""One and the Many"", ""Indeterminate Dyad"", ""The Form of the Good"", and other things described in *Philebus*, *The Republic*, *Parmenides*, etc.? Or is he talking about any old axioms, *archai*, in general? I've seen *nous* likened to intuition‚Äîyet another word associated with a vague, often irrational, part of thinking. I've also seen *nous* described as the faculty that directly apprehends intellectual objects, but that feels like a nebulous description. If *nous* is intuition and not ""first principles"", then it seems more like an intellectual muscle than knowledge, no? It also feels strange to interpret *nous* as intuition, given Aristotle's general resistance to Plato's theory of the forms (I take forms to be intellectual objects). Thus, *nous* eludes a simple, poignant, and directly relatable definition. 

Finally, there is the question of *sophia*. I've seen *sophia* taken as a general term for the intellectual virtues by Plato. And Aristotle seems to think that it is a combination of *episteme* and *nous* directed towards the highest principle, though how this precisely works seems a little bit tricky. I have a hard time understanding what Aristotle accepted as the ""highest principle"", besides *eudaimonia*, if he rejected the Form of the Good. On a side note, I wish Aristotle had accepted it as a given in *Nicomachean Ethics*, critiqued it as being too abstract on its own to serve as a guide for life, and then moved on with the practical exposition. It would have been ""more tidy"", but that might be my Platonic bent showing. Anyway, Aristotle also brings up the concept of *theoria* towards the end of *Nicomachean Ethics*, and that throws me through a loop. *Theoria* and *sophia* seem almost identical. What the hell is *theoria*? Is it the highest principle attained after contemplation? Is it intellectual prowess in general? I have no idea. It might even be similar to Plato's *episteme* as described in the Divided Line of *The Republic* for all I know. Here, I am also stumped. 

That summarizes my confusion. Am I on the right track? What am I missing? I'd greatly appreciate if there were any other ancient Greek philosophy lovers who could chime in with their wisdom!","What did episteme, nous, and sophia mean for Plato and Aristotle?",askphilosophy

""The Racial State and Totalitarian Society: Plato as Philosopher-King, or The Third Reich as Second Sparta"" (chapter from ""Greeks, Romans, Germans"") by Johann Chapoutot, very interesting French historian of Nazism, was also an illuminating read (and pretty convincing) about the way Nazis usurped classics.

Novel consciousness elicits more gravitational pull than shared ones. Consciousness is real but time exists only in the dimension of our imagination of measurements and not in space.

I got into a friendly argument with a friend (who is involved in philosophy academically), who was talking about logic and how it can be used to deduce things. I‚Äôm simplifying and risking sounding hackneyed but: 

 ‚Äú Ithink therefore I am, I think of God therefore he exists‚Äù 

My problem: this conclusion, although following logic, could be false. This statement does nothing to prove anything. Instead, it follows a logic thread which could ultimately be false. There is no irrefutable way to prove the existence of something. Essentially, I feel this line of logic is entirely intuitive and offers nothing substantial. Scientism is not the full answer, but by using statistical measures and utilizing basic logical decisions on validity, you can come CLOSE to determine whether there is a relationship. You are never 100% certain in science. And see I mention using logic to evaluate validity of your operationalization and such, but I am not ignorant to the fact that this could be faulty.

I‚Äôm very conflicted on this because as a Nazi witnessing such horrendous tortures, I wonder if they realize the same horrendous tortures done by their own party. He was a proud member of the Nazi party and would proudly show off his swastika.

I have known a few people who have only fans or do content like that and I think that sort of thing is becoming more normalized in modern society.

If it is morally permissible to be a sex worker or have an onlyfans, does the same apply to the person hiring/consuming that content? My intuition says hiring sex workers is bad, and I have heard and participated in many conversations mocking people who pay for onlyfans, so I feel like this is not an uncommon position.

I'm wondering whether my mentality is too twisted or my viewers' comprehension skills are lacking; what caused the poor reception it got?

For starters, nobody liked it, beside a couple of people. Second, people who dared to comment, say it's weird and creepy.

I dislike the weird term because people don't use them properly. Weird is something unusual, rare, and the concepts in my short story are very common in hentai; my CG has elements of gangrape, ugly bastard and NTR, which are common resources in hentai. In fact, I late realized it's a bit similar in plot to Otome Dori, which is maybe the only hentai I've seen at end. Reading reviews of the hentai, seems like a lot of people know about it but dislike it at the same time. They seem to dislike it because it's painful to watch, but still, they are watching it. Maybe it's somehow linked to the idea that ""suffering leads to knowledge"" (Something I head more than a decade ago). Maybe human suffering leads to understand its nature?

People say creepy to clasify concepts they don't understand. As it's always said, people fear what they don't understand. It's not fair to judge something you don't understand.

Moreover, people are judging my morals and attitude towards fantasies and my way of behaving. In other words, they think I fantasize, desire and enjoy the situations in my story. 

Isn't fiction supposed to be separated from reality? Why then a work of fiction generates judgement over how somebody is in reality? Personally I think people are being prejudiced and lacking critical thinking. They don't ask why, they just ask you to leave. 

You may wonder why I did this 3DCG. Since several years ago I realized I like trying to understand people, what moves them to be, do and think how they do. I also like to think about the way people react to different experiences, you can see that in how the mentality of the boyfriend changed so, apparently, unexpectedly, but it's based on my observation of humans appropiating other humans (For example, the idealization and figurative appropiation of music idols, that are frown upon when they appear publicly with a boyfriend/gf). My scene depicts a mixture of my current speculations of the criminal rapist mind, mixed with the fantastic and exhacerbated behaviour of standard hentai characters.

176,"Recently I suppose i have been thinking and getting the impression from what I am reading, that the argument for God is how do you get something from nothing?

Is that even right? It seems to me that the argument isn't that something exists at all.

We can imagine existence being eternal. That is just fine and dandy.

It's what was the first movement. Why did what exists, move in the first place? If you infinite regress in time to the first movement, you can find the source. I suppose obviously that's impossible.

I don't know why but it seems to me like people in general think of the argument as, there was once empty space, and then God created existence. Otherwise, how could it exist?

So now I ask additionally, how does one say that existence exists? I read on here at some point that existence exists is circular. It doesn't really mean anything.

But if we are talking about the first movement of an existing material, one must first say that something existed which did not need to be created. Which doesn't seem to be a problem like I said. The problem is the first movement.

But how do we say that existence existed in the first place? Clearly, if the argument is what caused the first movement, one must first say that what exists, was already there. Existence exists. I know it's not logical to say that but I don't know why or how to say it better.

So to reiterate my question. Is the argument about whether existence needed to be created, or is it that there needed to be a first mover?

The second question is how can we say that existence exists in a way that isn't wrong lol. I don't know how to put it. All I know is it's circular.

177,"First off: for almost a year now I have been struggling with what I think is existential OCD and have been experiencing on-and-off mild-to-severe depression. I recently went into a pretty depressed state again, and then also 'discovered' the debate of determinism and free will, which has made things much worse. In short: I can't stop thinking about it and I feel very helpless. I am aware that philosophy will definitely not be as helpful to me as psychological help, but I can assure you that I am already trying to work on these problems with a psychologist at the moment. No real success so far, but we're trying our best.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, onto the problem. I have done my research, both on this subreddit and outside of it, and I have found that most philosophers hold the position of compatibilism, the idea that determinism is right but that we still have free will. On a logical level I think I understand most of the arguments, but to me it still feels like knowing about determinism has taken away my (illusion of) control of my mental situation and adds yet another layer of problems that I have to 'beat' before I can be happy again.

&amp;#x200B;

I specifically struggle with the idea that humans do not make conscious decisions, but that everything we do is actually driven by unconscious sources that we are not aware of and our awareness is only an attempt to rationalise these unconscious drives after the fact. Regardless of whether the unconscious drives are still part of 'us' or regardless of the fact that I should theoretically still have 'control' over my actions in the sense that I can follow my drives, it still makes me feel like a witness 'stuck' in a movie that I have no conscious control over. If that movie were nice and enjoyable I probably would have much less of an issue with it, but as the situation stands right now, it makes me feel terrible and hopeless.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it has given me the idea that I can never be 'proud' of anything good I do again. If I had no other choice but to do the good things I do, if I didn't even consciously decide to do them but am only the witness that watches the 'animal' part of myself do those good things, how can I ever be proud of them?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like the only thing that could 'save' me from this despair is if science were to find out that we do have some capability to make conscious decisions that influence our biology, so that decision making turns out to be not only a bottom-up process of which we only have awareness, but also a top-down process that we can influence.

&amp;#x200B;

I am constantly struggling with intrusive thoughts about how determinism should mean that I can't be happy and/or am powerless. One part of this is that I have the compulsion to try to 'chase' my decision back to the moment I made it. But this is a wild goose chase and cannot be won. I feel like it is impossible to know exactly when I made the decision, but my thinking habits keep checking it and it hurts me a lot. The other part is an internal dialogue that goes something like this. When I do something good: ""I did something good"" --&gt; ""no, my unconscious brain made me do something good, I am only witnessing it"" --&gt; ""but that unconscious brain is also part of you, so *you* made the decision and can be proud"" --&gt; ""yeah, people say that and they may be right, but to me it doesn't *feel* that way!"" --&gt; ""you cannot be happy!""

Same goes whenever I think that ERP for the OCD may help: ""ERP may decrease the symptoms of OCD"" --&gt; ""but I never have a choice to do anything else, I am not consciously in control so whether ERP helps or not, or whether I even do ERP, is not up to me"" --&gt; I feel bad again.

It appears reddit has a very strong anti-corp sentiment and it's difficult to have a rational discussion on most subs. 

My whole premise is that while I agree that corporate greed is innately immoral, we should not direct our anger/hate towards the corporation itself but the system that allows it. (Immoral actions could be any examples, i.e. damages to the environment, exploitation of tax havens etc, but all within legal limits. We're not talking about illegal actions here.)

I understand the negativity towards this sentiment. Afterall, it's much easier to attribute the fault to the person (CEO)/organization that is performing these foul actions because they are literally the people that made these decisions. 

But logically, capitalism is a system with many parties. There are stakeholders, shareholders, capitalistic laws, incentives and disincentives put in place by gov, investors (retail and/or institutional), board of directors, executive management, employees etc. The system is designed in a way that drives corporations to make maximum profits. Morality is not something a corporation can realistically factor into their decisions. 

In these scenarios, how should one look at the responsibility? 

Should we attribute fault to:

1) The employees, for executing the foul actions

2) The management, for agreeing/approving/negligence on such actions

3) The board, for agreeing/approving/negligence on this plan

4) The investor (mom and pop - individuals) for buying the stock and demanding a maximum return on investment, thus financially support the continued actions

5) The institutional investors (e.g. pension funds) for buying the stock and demanding a maximum return on investment, thus financially support the continued actions

6) The gov - for neglecting these actions and not providing sufficient oversight and/or restraints on such actions

7) The democratic system - for allowing lobbying/bribe such that changes are not possible and laws are always in favour of corps

8) All of the above

9) None of the above

Personally, my gut tells me the fault lies in all 1-7, but it should not be evenly distributed. If I were to point my finger, it would be from bottom to top.

197,"**TL;DR: Given E=mc****^(2)****, how is matter** ***qualitatively*** **different from energy?**

I've been thinking about this for months and I'm definitely starting to see why language can cause unproductive (read: psychotic) feedback loops.

In our common (waking) reality, pantheists claim that ""all substances are, ultimately, God"". The bees are God, the bees' blood cells are God, the bees' blood cells' molecules are God, etc.

Theists and Panentheists agree that God is materially separate, in one way or another, from reality itself. The bees, their blood cells, and their molecules are all ""not God"" but were instead created by God.

But... how does God create something not inherently ""of God's constitution""? If matter/energy are materialized out of nothing, as is assumed in Abrahamic cosmology, isn't that ""stuff"" analogous to the ""stuff"" I materialize in my dreams every night? Hence the dream analogy: my dream's spatial landscape, its pseudo-autonomous characters, and all the sense-experiences either: (1) are literally me, or (2) they aren't literally me, and I just created them out of something else (thought? electricity?). I understand how my defined identity (""me"") can easily be expanded or contracted to delineate ""me"" vs ""not me"" in various ways, but if everything devolves into a mere language problem then I may need to rethink my choice of hobbies....

Snap back to reality.

For example, given Einstein's Mass-Energy equivalence formula (E=mc^(2)), is it fair to say that if God is ""E"" in that equation, that ""m"" is a hyper-condensed, and therefore *qualitatively* *different (?)*, form of E in the same way that a bee in my dream is different from me, the dreamer, who created and sustains the bee's appearance in spacetime?

Part of me thinks ""this isn't an important conversation anymore, bro"", but also the aggregate religious donation revenues in the US amount to over $50b annually, so at least a few people do still care about the nature of God. I just happen to think about it for free, as is evidenced by my diminutive social circle.

Which leads me to my underlying suspicion:

This conversation (the pan/en/theist spectrum) directly impacts the Christological question, because if everything is God, then it's not very difficult for someone to be ""God in the flesh"" if everyone is already ""God in the flesh"". Which then implies... could the theist/panentheist world-views simply have been politically inspired in order to maintain the perceived supremacy of God's worldly mediators?

(This last train of thought is endless, and may get me killed, so I'll stop here.)

Inb4: God is dead, God isn't real, etc. etc. I'm talking about Cosmological/Mind-Body Metaphysics, not Moral Authority Theology. ""God"" is here used as a linguistic symbol representing the ""universal dreamer"" who created/maintains the laws of physics as we know them.

For this to work, Hegel incorporates what he calls non-contradiction thinking. Only one pole can be true at any given time. Jameson rightly warns against reading into the dialectic as a unity of opposites, but rather as a way of thinking without positive terms (48).

Daniel Tutt succinctly summarises Jameson's point in his review. However, I am only halfway through the book and I'm having trouble understanding what happens to sublation. Could someone please explain to me how Jameson sees the Hegelian dialectic process?

Quantum mechanics, atomic half-life, etc. all seem to have some components that cannot be in any way predicted. How can a universe created by a sentient, all-powerful, logically consistent entity, have components that are not dictated by his own power, but instead by chance?

I compare this to the ability to simulate a universe with a computer; No matter how powerful your computer is, you cannot create a true randomness engine. You can simulate it, making your deterministic universe appear random, but that pseudorandomness eventually converges towards patterns. One might say that we can use physical phenomena from the outside world to generate true randomness on that computer, but it still seems like an obvious conclusion to me: In order for God to create randomness, he must be able to consult from something upon which he can exercise no power- even he would not know what the outcome of this randomness would be.

We no longer have any sympathy today with the concept of 'free will': we know only too well what it is the most infamous of all the arts of the theologian for making mankind 'accountable' in his sense of the word, that is to say for making mankind dependent on him.... I give here only the psychology of making men accountable. Everywhere accountability is sought, it is usually the instinct for punishing and judging which seeks it. One has deprived becoming of its innocence if being in this or that state is traced back to will, to intentions, to account able acts; the doctrine of will has been invented essentially for the purpose of punishment, that is of finding guilty. The whole of the old-style psychology, the psychology of will, has as its precondition the desire of its authors, the priests at the head of the ancient communities, to create for them selves a right to ordain punishments or their desire to create for God a right to do so.... Men were thought of as 'free' so that they could become guilty: consequently, every action had to be thought of as willed, the origin of every action as lying in the consciousness (- whereby the most fundamental falsification in psychologicis was made into the very principle of psychology).... Today, when we have started to move in the reverse direction, when we immoralists especially are trying with all our might to remove the concept of guilt and the concept of punishment from the world and to purge psychology, history, nature, the social institutions and sanctions of them, there is in our eyes no more radical opposition than that of the theologians, who continue to infect the innocence of be coming with 'punishment' and 'guilt by means of the concept 'moral world -order'.

I‚Äôm currently in a symbolic logic class, and I‚Äôm working on constructing and understanding valid and invalid arguments. 

In class the other day, I was asked if an argument can be valid with only false premises and a false conclusion, and I answered no and got it wrong. I came up with the following example:

P1: Kyle is an eggplant 
P2: All eggplants fly planes.
Conclusion: Kyle flies helicopters.

Using the following logic, I thought that false premises couldn‚Äôt have a false conclusion. 

 P1: Kyle cannot be an eggplant because he‚Äôs a human being; P2: an eggplant can‚Äôt fly a plane; Conclusion: Kyle may fly helicopters, but it‚Äôs a false conclusion because it doesn‚Äôt follow from the premises.

I was told ‚Äúan argument can be valid if and only if it is impossible for all the premises to be true and the conclusion false.‚Äù I‚Äôm a bit confused by that, and still confused on why an argument can be valid with false premises and a false conclusion. 

Additionally, I was working on making arguments valid that were initially invalid with the addition of another premise and came up with this example:

The argument:

The existence of change (C) in the world adequately negates the possibility of there being a perceivable and knowable truth that is absolute, i.e. ‚ÄúAbsolute Truth‚Äù (AT).

Since all truths are measured through the lenses of our perceptions, or perceptual consciousness, and since the reality of change has domain over our perceptual consciousness, one cannot rely upon one‚Äôs own consciousness to reveal Absolute Truth.

This is due to the fact that while we are conscious, all perceptions of our consciousness have the possibility of change associated with them. This possibility of change applies even to our most profound conscious states as well. Seeing as any truth that can be considered ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù must be changeless by necessity, it must then be concluded that the introspection of consciousness itself is unreliable in the search for Absolute Truth as well.

As such, while Absolute Truth may exist, it would be impossible for a conscious being to comprehend it, let alone express it.

0,"So I've been thinking and reading about utilitarianism. From what I've read I find weak negative utilitarianism, as in valuing minimizing suffering over maximizing happiness in some ratio where suffering = some multiple of happiness is the most compelling to me. 

However I feel like there should also be a distinction between inherently negative actions and actions which result in negative consequences. For example in the trolley problem where a child is on one train track and a group of people on the other, most people say you should pull the lever and divert an incoming train to save the group and kill the child. In another trolley problem where you are standing next to a obese person who if pushed would stop a train from crashing most people seem to be uncomfortable with that. The distinction to me seems that with the child your intended action is ""divert the train to save people"" which is a positive action, and the child dying is a negative consequence. With the obese person the intended action is ""push the obese person into the train"" which is a negative action done for a positive consequence of saving lives. Negative actions it seems are worse than negative consequences. 

Additionally I think that if I knew prophetically that a person's who's life was in danger would go on to murder a person (I cant stop this, its deterministic) I would not save their life, which seems to me that Negative consequences &gt; Positive actions.  

So instead of having the normal priorities of

Most modern Western ppls who are religious, (esp of the Judeo-Christian brand) are metaphysical believers of religion while eschewing religious morality to deploy their own ethics, leading to most Christians being ""Christmas/Easter"" church goers. The ever decreasing numbers of church goers has caused the Church to switch from a moral authority to becoming a mirror of ever smaller communities ethics, leading to ever granular protestant Christian denominations to vie for the remaining church goers (ie the church leaders are no longer ""calling the shots"" and churches are no longer driving morality for the most part, instead the participants political/ethical/social considerations are driving church ethical mandates. Ex. one church denomination will be politically Right, *against* drinking, *against* marijuana, and *against* LGBTQ+ ppls while another will be Right, *for* drinking, *against* marijuana, and *against* LGBTQ+. and yet a third will be Right, *for* drinking, *for* marijuana, and *against* LGBtQ+, etc. ie pandering) This has further lead to a diminished meaning as the 'inmates are running the asylum' which does not satisfy the need for an authority figure and/or higher power necessary for meaning to feel authentic. 

While this is going on, the number of atheist are growing. My argument is that Nietzsche (at least on this topic) was correct and our expanding realization of having no moral underpinning, no grounding to justify ethics is expanding in society leading to growing abandonment of truth uber alles as ppl are willing to ""stick their heads in the sand"" (from vaccine denial to claims about ['infinite numbers of biological sexes](https://massivesci.com/articles/sex-gender-intersex-transgender-identity-discrimination-title-ix/)' to [Flat Earthers](https://www.newsweek.com/shaquille-oneal-earth-flat-explanation-podcast-1736414)) and forgo objective truths as offered by science for meaning as generated by being a participant in culture (Culture Wars as it is termed in America) If I am correct about this then science is further fueling the divide as the more object truth it provides the more *disenfranchised* ppl feel from life; living in a nihilistic void and turning to any charlatan peddling meaning en masse. 

My questions are, if my assumptions, speculation, and interpretations are even remotely correct, what amount of culpability do scientist have in this feedback loop, if any at all? Does objective scientific truth, regardless of the price on society, have a value which demands its pursuit? Is our curiosity as a species such that even if it is determined science (or a specific study of science) is deleterious, costing more than it rewards, could we even pull the reins and stop progress or would that taboo make it all the more rewarding to study?

I found the Stanford Encyclopedia post very compelling:

&gt;At one time, philosophers thought there was a quick and easy answer to these questions, an answer that immediately discredited moral claims. That answer was that in psychology and biology our justifications can and do ultimately ground out in empirical observations, whereas nothing of the kind is available for moral theory. If true, this would explain in a sharp way why psychology and biology might have a real claim on our opinions while morality and alchemy and various crackpot theories do not. The former can be tested against experience and pass the test, while the latter, while testable, can be seen to fail utterly.

But didnt entirely get the rebuttal. Does morality not, like astrology just exist as a self-reliant system of principles that doesnt actually intersect with any real world evidence

&gt;Moral realists have three sorts of reply to the epistemic challenge they face. One is to argue that a proper appreciation of the ways in which all observation is theory laden leaves no real contrast between the observations that support psychology and biology and those that are appealed to supporting moral theories. As proponents of this view would have it, the process of justifying various scientific theories, which involves moving back and forth between particular specific claims and more general principles seeking a mutually supporting system, is matched step for step by when people develop and defend moral theories. In both cases specific judgments (concerning observations or the badness of a certain act, for instance) are tentatively accepted and an attempt is made to make sense of them by appeal to more general principles that explain the judgments. When the more general principles are available the specific judgments are taken as evidence for the principles and the principles reciprocate by helping to justify the thought that the specific judgments are accurate. But if no general principles are available the specific judgments are called into question and the suspicion is rightly raised that they might be illusory or misleading. Whether they are taken to be warranted is decided in large part, and rightly, by appealing to other principles that so far have themselves found support in their fit with still other specific judgments. The process is of necessity tentative and piecemeal but it is, many argue, nonetheless no different in science than in morality. All of this is, of course, compatible with thinking the process might end in failure‚Äîalchemy and crackpot theories are prime examples of how the attempt to sustain a systematic and mutually supporting set of beliefs can fail.

Hi All,  
Long time reader, first time poster.  
I have a question, i would like to discuss further.

So, for a little background.  
I have been pondering on the logic and rational reasoning behind why we act. And through my thinking, it occurs to me, that there are some fundamental actions that all creatures act upon, and i believe that these shared experiences and evolutionary shared traits, point towards self preservation and preservation of ones species to be logical framework for most actions in which life can justify the reasoning behind its actions.

Now that being said, We have all been through the Need vs Want differences, and we understand that a want is merely something that we would like to have /achieve etc. but, after a lot of thinking, Is a want merely a human seeking an certain emotional response from the action, eg happiness etc.  
So if something is not needed for survival, and it is merely for self interest. Is it logical to seek out this item/actions etc? Or are we acting upon illogical emotional reasoning, that is clouding the overall logical answer, ""This item is not needed""?

Now i understand that human (myself included) act illogically all the time, My reasoning for my favourite colour is not based in logic. it is purely subjective. Or my taste for music etc...

So if you also think that wants are illogical, then i guess my second question is:  
Can we still apply logic to the action of obtaining the illogical want? for example purchasing the lower cost item, or is the overall decision now illogical due to the fundamental framework being illogical to being with?","Are ""Want"" Logical?",askphilosophy
37,I'm an armchair philosopher who is just messing around and learning in my free time. I noticed that most arguments for the existence of God stem from monotheistic philosophers.

40,"I'm very much an amateur philosopher, so maybe I'm missing something, but I have a problem with definitional ideas being analytic. Actually, I have a problem with anything being understood as analytic aside from maybe perception itself.

Take the statement all bachelors are unmarried 

Some may say that this is merely tautological, but there seems to be some sort of intuition of knowledge here. So why is that the case? Well, I'd say that it's because the idea of the bachelor has come to mean something more than just an unmarried man.  In fact, I'd argue that the modern idea of a bachelor doesn't have much to do with being unmarried at all.

For example, I'd have a much easier time describing someone who is a financially successful younger man that wears a suit every day, pays a lot of attention to their physical features, is highly ambitious and independent, frequently goes out to social gatherings, but is also married a bachelor then someone who is 30, lives in there parents basement, doesn't work or take care of themselves, but is also unmarried.

I'm pretty sure the idea of bachelor did not always include the current archetype of bachelor, but if it did, I'm sure I could give other examples that explain this phenomenon. 

I can imagine far in the future the meaning of bachelor is expanded upon to the point where describing a bachelor as an unmarried man has no relation to the current meaning.

I also find it absurd to try and explore what it means to be a bachelor in some kind of universal sense because the idea of a bachelor seems to be entirely dependent on individual experience. It doesn't seem like a universal understanding of bachelor can ever be arrived at because it is completely reliant on the way in which it has been used when you've been exposed to it. 

This being the case (along with other things such as my understanding of philosophy of science), I'm starting to believe that any idea of a knowable universal truth is impossible and that what we call truth is merely a relation to utility.",Are relations to ideas actually unchanging?,askphilosophy
41,"My understanding is that under most modern schools of philosophical thought, the meaning of life is to choose a general set of philosophical principles and fulfill them.

It's easier to cause and sustain suffering than it is to cause and sustain pleasure. 

One person experiencing pleasure almost always comes at the expense of another's suffering, but the reverse is not true. Simple animals like arthopods or mollusks are believed to experience suffering, but may not be capable of experiencing pleasure as humans understand it. This indicates that reality is innately biased toward suffering over pleasure.

42,"Hello, I am looking for essays or talks which discuss and scrutinize the attitudes that Americans hold towards money. I think this counts as a question of ethics because my question is about what makes a life a good life.

What are the facts? For example, do people (maybe Americans in particular) feel embarrassed to tell other people that they make under $x/year? Do they think that having a higher paying job will make them much happier? Do they spend much of their free time shopping for items that they do not really need? Do they instantly categorize people they see based on how much money they estimate that the person makes, based on their appearance? Do they think that earning a lot of money is important for living a good life?

Why do people value money the way that they do? What influences shape the way that people think about money? For instance, do the TV shows and movies we watch somehow influence our beliefs about the significance of money?

46,"Hello! First of all, i'd like to say that this sub has been super helpful in the past few years; i've met great thinkers and oeuvres thanks to the dedicated people in here. So, thanks! I really appreciated it. But now i've come to ask yet another favor.  


I'm in the process of institutionalization of a project of lacanian psychoanalysis with some friends and colleagues, and within the range of activities that we plan to execute i'm responsible for the creation of courses, seminars etc., and the first one i'm already creating is one regarding the analysis of the articulation between epistemology, in its broader sense, and lacanian psychoanalysis. I seek to investigate the consistency of the lacanian work in the context of clinic, formation and transmission/discusion of its theory but also the consistency of the field with deals with questions of consistency itself and alike terms/questions, and see what results from it all, so we will investigate the notion of sophism, say, and also if, after a critical revaluation of this notion, if the use Lacan made of it makes sense.   


Before the request per se, here's how the course is being structured: there's three axes, three modules: one focused on epistemology, another in the intersection of epistemology and psychoanalysis, and the third and last one focused in at least 2 or 3 subjects in lacanian psychoanalysis using what has been discussed in the two previous parts.   


So what i'd like to ask is for you guys to see the bibliography i made so far and indicate if there's a canon that i'm not contemplating; if i should add some specific book or article, or if in your opinion there's already a text in there that shouldn't be. It would be an immense help! I'm comparing sources of arguments. I have been in contact with my university professors, but i was in psychology, and only met a few people in the philosophy department, so my contacts are few. Anyway, again: thank you!, and sorry for any linguistic mistake, i'm brazilian xD

I'd like to point out that some of the texts have already been read, that's why they're there; others have been indicated; others caught my attention in the summary. I've read the freudian oeuvre and a good part of the lacanian one, and i'm in this with 2 colleagues, which have their readings as well. This list is a referential one, the basic that we want to be kinda obrigatory and unavoidable to the formation of the people that come to us.

48,"I am attempting to identify the specific ethical theory that my philosophical views align most with. I'm not as well-versed in the many varieties, so the closest I have found is Utilitarianism, but it's not exactly accurate.

While I do believe that happiness and well-being should be maximized for all individuals, I also believe that some sacrifices aren't worth the reward, which partially contradicts the Utilitarian philosophy. For example, I don't believe that the loss of millions of lives for a minor(relatively-speaking) increase in overall happiness and well-being is a worthwhile sacrifice, but the loss of a few for a major increase would be. In addition, I believe that the duration of the increase should also be taken into account, as a short duration would not be as valuable as a longer one.

I also believe that a sense of justice (natural order or otherwise) should still be adhered to, albiet with the previous contradiction in mind. For example, I don't consider the consumption of farm-raised cattle to be a form of speciesism, in the same way that a natural predator consuming its prey wouldn't be considered speciesism, as that consumption is needed for survival. On the other hand, I believe that animal cruelty for any reason apart from being a worthwhile sacrifice as mentioned above, should be considered a crime.

For example, I am conscious of an object‚Äîthis dusty brick-wall‚Äîand I am happy at it: my consciousness has not transformed this brick-wall, as you say, into something that evokes happiness; no, the brick-wall was initially presented as something to arouse happiness, something that is something to arouse happiness.""

104,"I've been thinking about this for weeks and I really don't like the conclusion I came at. I really want to believe something else. Please criticize my conclusion.

I was thinking a lot about what is ""good"" and what is ""evil"". I looked at what we deemed to be good. For example, helping others in need, giving a person a compliment, etc. And the things we deem to be ""evil"" are generally things that are selfish or inconsiderate in nature. For example, stealing someone's money, committing murder, etc.

After going through it a lot I got a thought. I was thinking, when we do ""good"" things, they generally speaking still give us a benefit in some way. Whether it is the praise we get from the public of doing a good deed, or the opportunities it provides by having a good reputation as a consequence.

At my school I got the opportunity to meet a person who had sympathy for the second world war Germany's goals. He did not agree with extermination of Jewish people, but in his vision humanity was to be united by a single strong government that leads the people, and thus it was the natural obligation of said government to enact eugenics in order to move ""humanity as a collective"" forward and eradicate diseases, to create a ""stronger breed of humanity"".

It conflicts with everything I know, my family gave shelter to Jewish people who were being persecuted by the government. I have heard the stories countless times, and every single time I heard it I still agreed just as much that it was undoubtedly evil. But the person I spoke with didn't seem ""evil"", after we were done talking, my impression of him was that he was misguided rather than evil. If his ideal society would come to fruition then there isn't a doubt in my mind that people would suffer just as much as during the second world war, but I did not get the impression that he was ""evil"". He genuinely seemed to want ""good"", but only for a limited group of people.

This all arrives to the point I came at. When something is ""good"", it is beneficial for other people around you. Me making coffee for myself isn't good or bad, me making coffee for someone else is good. I participate in an act that helps other around me, therefore the act is rewarded with praise and called ""good"". And subsequently, if you make a cup of coffee and I take it from you, despite the fact that you can just make another one, the act is considered ""bad"".

Are ""good"" and ""bad"" merely just ""social guidelines"" of praise that we all subconsciously agreed on because it benefits us? I am really wrestling with this topic because I want to believe that there is more to it. I am really hoping that you can find a flaw in my logic, I want to believe something else.

The  phrase ""everything is subjective"" is a logical contradiction. This is  due to the fact that the phrase itself is a part of everything. If the  phrase is subjective, it may be false in some contexts. Which means it  is not objective that everything is subjective, which makes no sense. If  it is objective, then there are still objective things. In either case,  the phrase must be false.

If  we negate a contradictory expression like ""everything is subjective"",  we get ""at least one thing is objective"". Being as we are negating an  expression which evaluates to a value of ""false"", we get a ""true"" value.  So we know that it must be the case that there is at least one  objective thing, Even if it is the fact that there is at least one  objective thing.

121,"So, firstly, the question seems to assume that we have core values, which I am not 100% convinced about. Maybe a psychologist might tap in here as well, because I'm interested to see if there are any other models about how humans go about making decisions.

By core values, I mean those values which we cannot reduce down any further, such as 'a want to be happy.' We want to be happy because we want to be happy and we cannot provide any other rational explanation: it is intrinsic to us. 

Now, if someone decides they want to change this core value, what do we make of this? Let's imagine someone who decides they are going to make a conscious effort to stop being happy. They stop doing activities that make them happy, and every time they notice themselves feeling happy they try to change their state of mind by doing something difficult or tedious, or by trying to focus on negative thoughts. At the end of six months, they can say with an air of complete confidence that they are less happy than they have ever been. 

Is this even possible? If someone wants to no longer value happiness, does this already assume that the person no longer values happiness? 

Also, I presume if this person is making a conscious effort to stop valuing happiness, then they are doing so in the hopes of achieving some other goal. Like, we might imagine a mother who decides to stop valuing her happiness in order to value the life of her newborn child above anything else. Am I on the right track in thinking this way?

Let's say for example we wanted to argue on whether a freekick taker would shoot the ball faster than a running player it would be something like this:

ME: simple laws of physics tells us that two bodies in motion will conserve more momentum upon collision than a body at rest and another body in motion so assuming that the players are at the same speed and are going to hit the ball with perfect technique the running player would shoot faster.

\*around the middle of my statement up here he would interrupt and tell you You're giving too many premises\* and I'm like bro I'm giving you my entire argument, You're going to have to pick what you think is wrong with my argument and at that point you can tell me one of my premises is wrong.

HIM: the speed of a player taking a freekick is more than that of a player running without the ball

If a murderer were to ask about the location of an individual that I, for instance, knew about and that individual happened to be in my house, and I lied for the sake of his protection, why would Kant not agree with my lie that is formed upon protecting this individual?

I decided to do my digging on it and well, he says that you could somehow be responsible for the death of the individual in relation to the lie you created, but would you *really* be responsible? In his paper he stated ""if you have *by a lie* prevented someone just now bent on murder from committing the deed, then you are legally accountable for all the consequences that might arise from it."" but again, are you *really*? Also, in what sense are you held accountable? Legally in the sense of your own morals and ethics, or legally in the sense of an actual legal system which dictates the sanctions based on the crimes you commit and/or your partaking in such crime?

He also mentioned in relation to his moral law in Groundwork, that ones moral actions must be universalised and therefore we must do the right thing. From this point onwards, I find as if he is sort of contradicting his own logic. How can one argue that you should always tell the truth, and if you lie, you are held accountable for any wrongdoing that occurs to the individual, yet simultaneously arguing that you should always do the right thing, where the right thing could be the lie itself?

Take Alice and Bob for instance in this scenario construing the same logic. Alice is constantly trying to contact Bob, and Bob is attempting to break contact due to the bad individual he knows Alice is, but Alice doesn't know that Bob knows she is a bad individual. But Alice in this instance indefinitely strives for contact with Bob. If I lie and say that Bob is dead (when in fact he is not), so that Alice stops the pursue of contact with Bob, am I really a bad individual for not living up to ""always tell the truth"" with Kant's logic? The only way I see his logic as a success, is upon a condition of IF Alice were to see Bob alive. This would surely rule the logic heavily condition based, no? Meaning that the logic would only work under some scenarios, and cannot be generically approached as correct as he would argue (from what I understand). 

Disclaimer: I am not a philosopher nor have I ever studied it, but I do my reading on Philosophy in random parts as it really interests me. I love logic and arguing, and Kant's view specifically made me raise questions.

""Knowledge of situations and events in the world is represented by what might be called sequences of verbal snapshots. State S, constitutively described by a list of sentences true at time t asserting various n-adic predicates true of various particulars, gives way to state S', a similar list of sentences true at t'. Would it perhaps be better to reconceive of the world of planning in terms of histories and processes? Instead of trying to model the capacity to keep track of things in terms of principles for passing through temporal cross-sections of knowledge expressed in terms of terms (names for things, in essence) and predicates, perhaps we could model keeping track of things more directly, and let all the cross-sectional information about what is deemed true moment by moment be merely implicit (and hard to extract - as it is for us) from the format. These are tempting suggestions, but so far as I know they are still in the realm of handwaving.""

I understand the two first sentences, but not what follows from ""Would it be perhaps..."". 

I have three questions:

1) What are the ""temporal cross-sections"" ?

2) Am I right to assume that ""classical approaches"" are those that seek to model human cognition in a way analogous to turing machines ? And if yes what can I read to understand it better ? 

2) Is ""to reconceive of the world of planning in terms of histories and processes"" what the connectionist approach is or is it a third way (I believe this is not the same as connectionism but I may have not understood what Dennett means) ?

155,"I have been reading up on Logos, its different meanings, how it came about with the pre-socratics and how the concept has influenced large parts of philosophy, theology etc.

One thing that I have been reading  is the criticism of Logos by Heidegger. One Russian mystical scholar Alexander Dugin (who obviously is not very popular right now but nonetheless has some interesting, if obscure and sometimes borderline schizophrenic views imo) claims to read or take from Heideggers work that the Logos centered West has eventually lead to its collapse and that there was something ‚Äúin‚Äù this concept of Logos that made it so. As such he proposes to return to a Chaos as it was pre-logos, because Chaos includes things as inclusivity, matriarchy etc. where Logos is seen as exclusive, patriarchal etc.

While i already struggle with understanding these concepts on their own, I tend to think I get the gist of it in a vacuum. But that understanding vanishes once I try to apply the concepts to other fields of thought. My main field of interest is Islamic theology and history. Philosophy is just a side interest of mine. Because of this, whenever I do read philosophy, I always try to understand how a certain philosophers idea or concept might translate to the Islamic world, which imo becomes quite hard for modern era philosophers.

This is also true for the concept of Logos itself as well as the above mentioned return to Chaos that Dugin describes. What interests me is that Dugin himself is an Orthodox Christian and to me it seems weird that he would propose a destruction of Logos since in Christianity Christ is often identified as the Logos, yet I can kinda make sense of that if one takes a different meaning of what Logos actually is.

But when I try to implement the concept to the world  of Islamic theology it becomes even harder. Logos in itself is already hard to identify within Islam for me at least. Seeing that the underlying reason of everything always goes back to Allah one could identify him as the Logos, but also the Prophets, or specifically Muhammad, or the Lawh al Mahfuz, or the qalam. Some medieval theologians have engaged with the concept of Logos but I‚Äôve never found it quite satisfying.Take Dugin‚Äôs concept of Chaos and the whole becomes even harder to understand. Especially since Dugin describes Chaos as that one primordial thing that precedes Logos. Yet simultaneously Dugin calls for Muslims to engage with his ideas (not just politically but metaphysically) yet I find it very hard to relate his metaphysical concepts in any way to Islamic theology and understand how they might fit. Can someone help me

Small disclaimer: Although Im currently reading Dugin I‚Äôm not at all advocating for the political situation which he has been a supporter off.

156,"Lately I have been focused on the relationship between nature and morality. The fourth cause of change in nature of Aristotle is the ""final cause"", which describes the purpose of the movement, or a teleological argument. The thing is, to have a plan or objective you need to have an intention or a desire, wether it is from a god or a human. For Spinoza, who argues that desire is entangled with ethics, it could make sense to link any teleological argument with ethics. 

So, could we conceive a teleological argument which is not influenced by desire? If we believe in a deterministic world, then every cause-effect relationship will ""achieve"" it's final cause, so we shouldn't be bothered by this. That would make the ""teleological argument"" just an a posteriori explanation of the event. However, it 

Although this can look pointless, I am interested as an ecologist exploring the relationship of evolution (which is strongly linked to desire) and morality/ethics (both for our concept of nature and for the practical ethics of wildlife conservation).

Could we talk about ""what is natural"" without stating first the desires that are limiting the classification of ""natural""? Obviously this wouldn't apply to the purely materialistic concept of nature.

157,"
The concept of non-ending things has rose a lot of questions and ""realizations"" for me. Maybe a good place to start explaining this idea is by thinking of Zeno's dichotomy paradoxa, we all know he argued that motion was but an illusion because his belief that an infinite amount of motion is impossible. From point A to point B, an infinite amount of half points must be crossed, which is thought by zeno to be impossible. 

Now let's think about the concept of time, is there an infinite amount of half points from point A to point B in time? An example of this would be from one second to another. One could argue to zeno (if they could) that motion is very well possible because there are an infinite amount of half points in time for infinite motion to occur. Now with the idea that things are infinitly divisible, who are we to say that everything isn't in a constant state of infinite? Think of things being infinitely small or large, why would this not be true? If existence is infinitely large, then are there an infinite amount of the same things repeating? Let's say thing can be  infinitely small and you had a microscope that could zoom in infinitely, would there be a point to where you find another version of yourself doing the same thing? Does everything repeat infinitely? Is everything in a constant state of infinite?

Say we have a computer that can take our memories of someone and place it into a metaverse. Now say that the memory of the person we put in there was a dear friend we worked with to make this machine and we viewed them as a person who knew the entire ins and outs of this system and we injected that memory of the person into this metaverse

Would the memory quickly realize they are just a memory in a computer system? If they did realize would they view themselves as a copy of that person or would they disassociate themselves by saying they are a new being entirely.

For a different example we created a clone of a friend who we view as smart but they didn't help us make the machine and injected that memory into a clone.

Would the clone quickly realize what they are due to the fact we viewed them as smart? If that's the case then what connections could that be to measure the way we view people as smart? If we viewed someone as lazy but also in the same thread we viewed them as smarter than us would the memory be smarter than our actual view of our friend.

By this I don't necessarily mean consistency in the sense of logical consistency (or consistency as pertains to discourse), but consistence as a kind of *state of being*, as with ex-istence or per-sistence. This is a big theme in Badiou, for instance, who writes of consistent and inconsistent multiplicities, and occasionally also gets mentioned in Deleuze, who in his late work talks of laying out planes of consistency and so on. The details here are not that important, but what is interesting to me is the use of 'consistency' to speaks about 'things', as it were, rather than words. 

The interest to me is that consistence has a more 'processual' feel to it (as in 'process philosophy'), of things being made and unmade, rather than the more stark sense of ex-istence which has overtones of being a yes-or-no questions (does X exist?). I say this with apologies to Heideggerians who like to emphasise the ex-static structure of existence and so on.

172,"I‚Äôve been trying to develop an idea for quite a while now, but I seem to be stuck at the moment. I would appreciate your input and candid comments. 

An issue I encountered while doing work in clinical ethics is that the clinical ethics concepts (autonomy, beneficence, etc.) were so elastic to be able to fit a particular clinical summary and ethical issue, that they essentially had no real meaning whatsoever, but that which it had at that time to fit a narrative. Those concepts became this bucket I filled with whatever meaning they could hold so we could do our ethical analysis. 

Instead of expanding our lexicon, we simply rely again and again on the same concepts. They take whatever we throw at them, each means so many things that they cease to mean anything at all. We stretch the concepts to the point they are simply empty words that we ascribe whatever meaning works. They are empty buckets, and we can use them at our whim to justify our desired outcome.

I think it is a symptom of a deeper issue that we are experiencing as bioethicists. We are trying to fit new issues into old concepts, and that limits our ability to properly identify and tackle issues. 

We must understand and accept that this exercise necessarily leads to the fact that bioethical concepts might not work or have an intended use at some point, and we should dispose of them, create new ones, expand our list, or simply revisit the whole thing. Rather than keep stretching concepts to the point they mean whatever we want them to mean, we must find a way to have good bioethical concepts to use. 

So my proposition is this: bioethical concepts must come from our surroundings. They must, to a certain extent, be an accurate representation of our surroundings. Stated differently, we must be able to pinpoint our surroundings to justify a bioethical principle. The point is to mirror nature as we conceptualize bioethical principles. I think this would give us some conceptual weight. 

This leads me to further questions:
How can we acquire bioethical principles? We would have to make certain assumptions, or we would go down a rabbit hole. 

We must be able to find bioethical concepts in nature (how do we acquire that knowledge - generally speaking? - this creates an epistemological problem). Then, we must find an appropriate concept for them (how do we label them then? This creates a possible analytical problem).

This is where I‚Äôm stuck. I have to confess I haven‚Äôt read much beyond certain conceptual ethics, conceptual engineering, and Rorty passages. I would appreciate any direction (or if this route is even something I should invest my time in). 

I want to add that I understand that my problem is familiar with any topic that has to do with ""knowledge"" of social issues. 

After all, everything hangs in a ""pact"" where we all decide that some words mean something in particular. 

Maybe the best way to go about this is to analyze the problematic aspects of bioethical concepts and then arrive at a more precise definition?

176,"I am specifically referencing later in the paper where he goes over possible objections, more specifically, objection 2. He says that many philosophers make the mistake of thinking that the premise ""one ought to keep one's promises"" as evaluative rather than descriptive. He says that this question is rather an internal, not external, question. I understand this to mean that it may be perfectly valid to question whether we have an objective reason to accept the institution of promising (just like any other institution), but that when we make a promise, or talk about promises, we have already accepted this institution and it is thus tautological that one should keep one's promises. I understand how this is descriptive rather than evaluative, and herein lies my confusion. 

For the sake of clarity in the next few section I will present his argument here:

 '(1) Jones uttered the words ""I hereby promise to pay you,  
 Smith, five dollars.""  
 (2) Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars.  
 (3) Jones placed himself under (undertook) an obligation  
 to pay Smith five dollars.  
 (4) Jones is under an obligation to pay Smith five dollars.  
 (5) Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars'

(The Philosophical Review, Jan., 1964, Vol. 73, No. 1 (Jan., 1964), p. 44).

I have always understood the is-ought problem to be something external to institutions. First, let us assume that it is. If it is, than I find Searle's entire point to be pointless. Yes, if you accept the institution of promising you ought to keep your promises, but this is internal to the institution. So, it would seem that I was mistaken and that the is-ought problem can also apply *internal* to  an institution. This still does not clear it up for me. If I already accept an institution, I am already accepting an evaluative. So, while there may only be descriptive and tautological statements in Searle's argument, it seems to me that they are only so because of an evaluative statement presupposed. 

In other words, *of course* you can cross the is-ought gap if you already accept an institution because you are *already* operating under an ought. You are *already* accepting an institution. It seems there is another (tautological) part to his argument.

 (1) *Having already accepted the institution of promises,* Jones uttered the words ""I hereby promise to pay you, Smith, five dollars.""  
 (2) Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars.  
 (3) Jones placed himself under (undertook) an obligation  
 to pay Smith five dollars.  
 (4) Jones is under an obligation to pay Smith five dollars.  
 (5) Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars

This entire argument seems to be a tautology. If you accept that you should keep your promises, you should keep your promises (and by making promises you accept that you should keep them). This shows that if you make a promis you should keep it, not because of some objective reason, but because when you make a promise you accept an institution that tells you you should keep your promise. This argument then, seems to be some sort of principle of non contradiction. ""If you say you ought to keep your promises (a statement that is imbedded in the act of making a promise) you ought to keep your promises."" What does this show? You ought to listen to the moral theory you accept! .... This is no way tells me anything about morals, it seems like it is rather giving you the best way to follow an ethic that *you already accept*. I get it is different than saying, ""If you think you ought not to murder people, then you ought not to murder people,"" because a promise implies that you should keep it, but murder doesn't imply you shouldn't do it. I get that, but all this does is make the argument seem even *more* circular.

For there was a good roadstead there, in which foreign ships also liked to anchor: those ships took many people with them, who wished to cross over from the Happy Isles. So when Zarathustra thus ascended the mountain, he thought on the way of his many solitary wanderings from youth onwards, and how many mountains and ridges and summits he had already climbed.

&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Yea! To look down upon myself, and even upon my stars: that only would I call my summit, that hath remained for me as my last summit!‚Äî  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus spake Zarathustra to himself while ascending, comforting his heart with harsh maxims: for he was sore at heart as he had never been before. And when he had reached the top of the mountain-ridge, behold, there lay the other sea spread out before him; and he stood still and was long silent. The night, however, was cold at this height, and clear and starry.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I recognise my destiny, said he at last, sadly. Well! I am ready. Now hath my last lonesomeness begun.

&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄîDeeper down into pain than I ever ascended, even into its darkest flood! So willeth my fate. Well! I am ready.

&gt;Whence come the highest mountains? so did I once ask. Then did I learn that they come out of the sea.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;That testimony is inscribed on their stones, and on the walls of their summits. Out of the deepest must the highest come to its height.‚Äî  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus spake Zarathustra on the ridge of the mountain where it was cold: when, however, he came into the vicinity of the sea, and at last stood alone amongst the cliffs, then had he become weary on his way, and eagerer than ever before.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Everything as yet sleepeth, said he; even the sea sleepeth. Drowsily and strangely doth its eye gaze upon me.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;But it breatheth warmly‚ÄîI feel it. And I feel also that it dreameth. It tosseth about dreamily on hard pillows.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Hark! Hark! How it groaneth with evil recollections! Or evil expectations?

&gt;Ah, that my hand hath not strength enough! Gladly, indeed, would I free thee from evil dreams!‚Äî  
&gt;

&gt;Thus spake Zarathustra, and laughed thereby a second time. Then, however, he thought of his abandoned friends‚Äîand as if he had done them a wrong with his thoughts, he upbraided himself because of his thoughts.

183,"Hello! My friend and I are self-learning philosophy-interested folks and are locked in a debate. I have always thought myself an Idealist, and recently put words to my current views on substance. He disagrees and says he thinks my views constitute physicalism. I'll list out my view here, I suspect not all the terms are perfect jargon, but do think they are decently defined.

-1 substance that reality is made of

-1 type of force that partitions the substance into different forms (well call it awareness)

-All forms of substance maintain some of the awareness that shaped them

-Consciousness is defined as a form/collection of forms that has awareness of its own awareness

-To have properties is to have awareness, and to have awareness (of substance and of forms) is to shape substance into forms as a product of enacting that awareness, thus creating the discreet bounds of an object

-Those bounds are found not in the object itself (there are no discreet objective boundaries) but within all the forms enacting awareness on the object
-Thus the physical world is made of objects- that is, the process of forms enacting awareness on one another gives them properties that well call spacial and temporal properties (physical properties)

-Those physical properties exist solely in the bonds of awareness between forms, but that is not a lesser existence in any sense. *The physical world exists as a product of the mechanics of substance and awareness, but it is not made of substance.*


I would call this view idealism because it ultimately holds that the physical world isn't made of substance, and highlights the importance of *awareness at least if not outright minds* as the substrate by which physical reality exists

He views it as a physicalist view because the substance itself is mind-independent even if the objects aren't

I retorted that that, while the substance itself may be mind-independent, the physical world/ the physicals properties of objects are not.

I could also see an argument for calling it a dualist view, since one could argue that the initial carving-out force ought to be considered a substance (I do not hold this view though).

Ultimately, we are both learning, and I suspect there is much wrong with the view itself and that it will change as I grow more learned. I will gladly accept critique on the view itself, but my main reason for posting is to find out who is right about how it be classified.

195,"I've done some basic reading on metaethics, and I simply don't understand what moral realists mean when they say morality is objective.

Here's what objective and subjective mean to me:

* A statement is objective if it is capable of being determined without the mind of a human. The statement ""this glass of water has a temperature of x"" is objective because temperature is simply a function of the activity of the water molecules, which would be the case even if no humans existed.  No two humans could possibly disagree about the temperature of a glass of water (assuming they are both happy that the thermometer they are using is working properly).
* A statement is subjective if it is the product of human thought.  The statement ""vanilla ice cream is good"" is something that a human might say, but there's no truth value to it because it's simply the product of a human mind.  There's nothing analogous to the glass of water or the thermometer.

Now, take the statement ""it is moral to do X.""  This statement seems to me to be more like ""vanilla ice cream is good"" and not at all like ""the glass of water has a temperature of x.""  

* There's no thermometer we can use to determine if it is moral or immoral to do x.  
* Two reasonable people can disagree on whether it is moral/immoral to do x, and there's no way to say that one is right and the other is wrong.

198,"The question seems very general but I'm asking about a very specific thing: if a different person describes to you an experience that you're incapable of experiencing, how can you decide whether or not to believe them? What if many people describe the same experience but you still can't?

Concrete example: a lot of people describe cilantro as having a bad taste similar to soap. If I don't taste soap when I eat cilantro and I'm faced with this claim my first instinct is to believe it cause why would they lie, but then someone tells me ""it's not true it's bullshit, they just don't like cilantro so they make up an excuse and delude themselves and others into believing it so they can feel special"". I have no argument against this statement but my intuition says there has to be one. What's the argument?

To clarify a bit: I don't care about the science or any empirical experiments to prove or disprove those claims, I'm asking from a purely philosophical and societal perspective, what's the approach to believe or not believe claims about experiences alien to us? In the case of cilantro it's been experimentally verified but what if it's a completely new claim? Another weird example that apparently is real, is that some people claim to smell ants and describe the smell as lemony. let's go completely out there with this, what if some people claimed they saw a ufo at a specific date? or what if some people claimed to see a new color? 

The only argument my intuition says might work would be to say that, to disbelieve new experiences would be historically ignorant because generally people don't lie about those things, but I don't know if that's actually true, I don't know of many examples or counterexamples to actually use this argument. 

Final note and to bring this back to earth: to me this is maybe most relavant in a real world example called ""Multiplicity"" or ""Plurality"" in which a person claim to host multiple consciousnesses in their body, each expressing a degree of individuality. This is a completely ""internal"" or ""hidden"" matter in that it doesn't connect to our sensory faculties in any measurable way and any experiment we do to verify its sincerity could be used to justify the opposite, e.g. by saying it's just people convincing themselves of things that don't exist, so in practice we just have to make a decision on whether or not we choose believe it, so what are the arguments for that? There are more examples I can bring up but I'd rather leave out so the discussion doesn't get too focused on politics, but I'm sure you can name a few examples yourself.

199,"so, I wonder about the ethical implications after watching some (clearly) biased conservative podcast. 

The argument against nonmonogamy being ethical is that it can destabilize the stability of society because when people dont pair bond, presumably the distribution will be that less men are judged by women as attractive than the other way around, i.e. sexual gratification will be very unevenly distributed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I personally see some potential flaws but idk if they can do away with the argument. Im not sure if its my responsibility to have less casual encounters because of that. Also the whole logic seems to apply only to emotional pair bonding, because lots of people will have casual sex nevertheless in between relationships, even if they are monogamous. If anything I think we could make a case for people with a highly frequent dating life to not be a macho, be nice and encouraging to others and so on.

205,"***TLDR: Concepts of masculinity and femininity go way beyond biological differences between sexes. Scientifically speaking, biological differences were probably just the starting point for social and cultural construction of these concepts. So from this point of view, these concepts are nothing special, they are just mere human inventions... perhaps useful fictions even. I basically agree with this scientific point of view. Still given the cultural universality of these concepts across different and unrelated cultures and civilizations, given how these concepts can be applied to such a huge variety of items (such as perfumes, watches, etc...) , given how extremely complex these concepts are, yet, at the same time extremely clear and easily recognizable, I'm wondering if it makes sense to think of them as some universal, transcendental and ideal principles, almost in platonic, idealist way?***

I know this might sound a bit woo-woo, but I hope philosophically minded people are also open minded enough to entertain these ideas.

If we speak strictly scientifically, masculinity and femininity and cultural concepts and social constructs that are ultimately derived from biological differences between sexes.

Biological differences between sexes aren't that big though. They encompass mostly things related to reproduction and mating in general, with the rest being pretty similar for both sexes. At least this is the case for most species. Some species have a bit more pronounced sexual dimorphism.

In humans, sexual dimorphism, strictly biologically speaking, isn't that big, but we enhance it through fashion, make-up, etc...

So all in all, actual differences between sexes are rather small, and specific to just one domain in life - things related to reproduction.

When we think about some animals, for example dogs and cats, we usually don't pay much attention to their sex. A dog is a dog, regardless of his/her sex.

For some other animals such as chickens or cattle we pay much more attention to sex. Conceptually we see bulls much differently from cows, and roosters much differently from hens.

Anyway... those are all just some examples, and I've started derailing it, so I want to go to the point:

on top of biological sex differences, which are generally small (but a bit bigger in some species) and specific to just one function in life, we humans have developed the concept of gender and concepts such as masculinity, femininity, etc.

Objectively speaking such concepts (femininity, masculinity) are nothing special, they are quite prosaic, and just inventions of human mind and human culture, based on sex differences and different roles for genders in society.

But... a part of me is not satisfied with this answer. Here's couple of reasons why:

1) Many different and mutually distant and disconnected cultures have developed very similar concepts of masculinity and femininity - as if there is something towards which our ideas converge, across multiple civilizations, like some kind of cultural universal.

2) Some cultures make really a big deal of gender, and especially about concepts of masculinity and femininity. Some cultures have even formalized it and included it into their traditional philosophy, for example in Chinese culture there is the concept of Yin (feminine principle) and Yang (masculine principle).

3) It is really remarkable just how many things in our today's society is gendered, and how easy and intuitive it is to recognize in an instant which item is ""male"" and which item is ""female"". For example, male perfumes and female perfumes are based on very similar ingredients. And objectively speaking there might be more variety ***within*** each of these groups, then the difference between male and female perfumes. But, in spite of that, we can instantly and effortlessly recognize which perfume is for men, and which is for women, based on smell. As if there truly is some kind of universal feminine and masculine essence that allows us to easily and flawlessly tell one from the other.

And that's just the beginning: there are male and female versions of: sunglasses, hats, watches, notebook covers, bags, wallets, umbrellas, and what not... and it's extremely easy to distinguish between them... as if there is really some universal, almost cosmic principle, that decides what is masculine and what is feminine, a principle that goes way beyond things related to biological sex differences.

So, now I'm wondering:

a) given that concepts of masculinity and femininity are quite similar and universal between different cultures

and

b) given that we have such instant and intuitive understanding of what is masculine and what is feminine

does it make sense to entertain the idea of masculinity and femininity as some universal, cosmic, ideal or transcendental principles?

Materialistically minded scientists would say that those are just concepts that humans constructed in their culture. **I agree with the materialists.** Because not agreeing with them would force me to completely change my worldview. Scientific and non-mystical explanations are still kind of most satisfying.

But one part of me wants to entertain the idea of masculinity and femininity as some ideal principles.

Unlike materialists, platonically and idealistically minded philosophers, might say that we never constructed these ideas (of masculinity and femininity), but that we just discovered them, and that they always existed in their ideal form in the world of ideas, just waiting for someone to discover them.

Maybe such thinking is not completely without merit.

For example if we take the concept of the bicycle. Today most bicycles are very similar and our idea of bicycles is very clear. But initially bicycles took many different forms before they converged towards the form known today. Perhaps, they were just gradually approaching and converging towards the most ideal form of the bicycle from the world of ideas.

Another reason why I think entertaining the idea of masculinity and femininity as ideal concepts, or universal principles might be worthy is because these concepts are at the same time **extremely complex and extremely clear.** It's kind of unlikely that humans can construct so easily a concept that is both extremely complex and extremely clear.

Here's what I mean:

To say that feminine is just gentle, meek, nurturing, cooperative, vulnerable, etc... and that masculine is just aggressive, competitive, determined, intimidating etc... would be incorrect. That would be a gross oversimplification.

You can easily find women who are, for example, very aggressive, demanding, competitive, and at the same time very feminine.

Or you can find men that are gentle and nurturing and cooperative, yet still very masculine.

You can find the opposite examples too: there are men who are aggressive, intimidating, etc... yet... not masculine at all.

So reducing the concepts of masculinity and femininity to such stereotypes is very wrong.

We can easily tell between simply gentle and nurturing on one hand, and feminine on the other hand. Those are different concepts.

Just like we can tell the difference between aggressive and masculine.

This shows that concepts of masculinity and femininity are very very complex and nuanced, yet, we can extremely easy recognize them.

We can easily recognize them, yet we can't easily define them. As if they are truly ""not from this world""... indeed very elusive concepts, yet so very clear.

So does it make any sense to think of them as some universal cosmic principles?

237,"The question seems very general but I'm asking about a very specific thing: if a different person describes to you an experience that you're incapable of experiencing, how can you decide whether or not to believe them? What if many people describe the same experience but you still can't?

Concrete example: a lot of people describe cilantro as having a bad taste similar to soap. If I don't taste soap when I eat cilantro and I'm faced with this claim my first instinct is to believe it cause why would they lie, but then someone tells me ""it's not true it's bullshit, they just don't like cilantro so they make up an excuse and delude themselves and others into believing it so they can feel special"". I have no argument against this statement but my intuition says there has to be one. What's the argument?

To clarify a bit: I don't care about the science or any empirical experiments to prove or disprove those claims, I'm asking from a purely philosophical and societal perspective, what's the approach to believe or not believe claims about experiences alien to us? In the case of cilantro it's been experimentally verified but what if it's a completely new claim? Another weird example that apparently is real, is that some people claim to smell ants and describe the smell as lemony. let's go completely out there with this, what if some people claimed they can saw a ufo at a specific date? or what if some people claimed to see a new color? 

The only argument my intuition says might work would be to say that, to disbelieve new experiences would be historically ignorant because generally people don't lie about those things, but I don't know if that's actually true, I don't know of many examples or counterexamples to actually use this argument. 

Final note and to bring this back to earth: to me this is maybe most relavant in a real world example called ""Multiplicity"" or ""Plurality"" in which a person claim to host multiple consciousnesses in their body, each expressing a degree of individuality. This is a completely ""internal"" or ""hidden"" matter in that it doesn't connect to our sensory faculties in any measurable way and any experiment we do to verify its sincerity could be used to justify the opposite, e.g. by saying it's just people convincing themselves of things that don't exist, so in practice we just have to make a decision on whether or not we choose believe it, so what are the arguments for that? There are more examples I can bring up but I'd rather leave out so the discussion doesn't get too focused on politics, but I'm sure you can name a few examples yourself.

238,"To rephrase it as a question: why is intentionality used as an argument in theory of mind discussions?

To start off I'm a beginner in philosophy and my knowledge is generally superficial. I've heard intentionality described as ""the property of mental states to be about things, or the aboutness of thoughts"". I'm not sure if this is a cultural difference but this literally makes no sense to me, especially when it's used against physicalism and functionalism. ""If mental states are purely physical, how can they be about something?"" this makes as much sense as saying a poem isn't physical because it's about the love, or a painting isn't physical because it represents nature. A lot of things represent other things, so why do we think of mental states being about something as such a strange and transcendental thing and use it to justify dualism when it's just a trivial matter of how we subjectively make sense of the world? My name refers to me, does that mean my name is demonstrating intentionality? how about the word ""snow"" on a piece of paper, is it intentional because it's about snow? how about a statue of a famous person?

In conclusion it seems to me like intentionality is complete nonsense and as soon as it comes up in theory of mind I can't keep paying attention cause it sounds so silly. Am I misunderstanding what intentionality is? Maybe I just don't get it or I'm biased against it cause I agree with a more functionalist understanding of the mind?

""Such 'philosophical' uses of language, on this view, create the very philosophical problems they are employed to solve.""

...

**History**

&amp;#x200B;

Early analytic philosophy had a less positive view of ordinary language. Bertrand Russell tended to dismiss language as being of little philosophical significance, and ordinary language as just too confused to help solve metaphysical and epistemological problems. Gottlob Frege, the Vienna Circle (especially Rudolf Carnap), the young Wittgenstein, and W. V. O. Quine all attempted to improve upon it, in particular using the resources of modern logic. In his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus Wittgenstein more or less agreed with Russell that language ought to be reformulated so as to be unambiguous, so as to accurately represent the world, so that we can better deal with philosophical questions.

&amp;#x200B;

By contrast, Wittgenstein later described his task as bringing ""words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use"".\[4\] The sea change brought on by his unpublished work in the 1930s centered largely on the idea that there is nothing wrong with ordinary language as it stands, and that many traditional philosophical problems are only illusions brought on by misunderstandings about language and related subjects. The former idea led to rejecting the approaches of earlier analytic philosophy‚Äîarguably, of any earlier philosophy‚Äîand the latter led to replacing them with careful attention to language in its normal use, in order to ""dissolve"" the appearance of philosophical problems, rather than attempt to solve them. At its inception, ordinary language philosophy (also called linguistic philosophy) was taken as either an extension of or as an alternative to analytic philosophy.

32," I find life's pleasures to be insufficient, personally. I don't find the effort I have to put in on a daily basis to be worth the rewards I rip.

There are so many things we have to keep a track of - work, school, hygiene,  cooking, relationships, workouts, health, appointments, house chores and the list goes on. Our lives basically revolve around school and then work, work that for majority is nothing but a means to an end. Work alone takes majority of our waking time assuming 8h sleep. It dictates  the tempo of our days - go to sleep early, wake up early, eat, shit, shower, dress up, get ready quickly. It sucks out most of our mental and  physical energy for the day. And it's just work alone out of dozens of responsibilities. And yet most people seem to be at peace with the struggle.

I can't find the same appreciation, that spark that everyone else seems to have found. Perhaps they never had to search for it. I can't comprehend how the average daily pleasures make up for a meaningless existence full of worry, struggle and suffering.

35,"A common definition of observable is ‚Äúdirectly perceivable by the senses"" (as per the SEP). At first, this criterion seems to divide entities into two discrete categories -- either one senses something directly or one does not. But, consider: it's really only a matter of degree that separates (1) an ‚Äúunobservable‚Äù alpha-particle which causes a Geiger counter to audibly click, from (2) an ‚Äúobservable‚Äù elephant reflecting the sun‚Äôs light onto our retinas. In the former case, there are two steps ‚Äì the particle activates the Geiger counter, which produces a sensible secondary effect ‚Äì whereas in the latter case, there is a single step. But, this division into steps is arbitrary.

Even if there were a continuous spectrum of observability, from ""direct"" to ""less direct"",  I don‚Äôt think the notion would be well-defined. For starters, the scale would vary from person to person and from moment to moment. For a blind person, the meteor you observe streaking across the sky is unobservable. Similarly, if you were to become blind tomorrow, what was once observable would no longer be so. 

In an attempt to deal with this, one might define observability based on a kind of average human ability, rather than on a specific organism's perceptions. But I still don‚Äôt see how this can work. For example, how would we rank the following situations: (1) Looking at something using eyeglasses, (2) Looking at something through a microscope, (3) Looking at something using the (internal) lenses in one's eyes, (4) Looking at something on a hot day, and there is a refractive blur due to the hot air. Physically, all of these situations are equivalent: light rays are refracted and change direction before being observed. Should the magnification of the device matter? Should the fact that glasses are instruments designed by humans, whereas heated air occurs naturally, matter? Should the lens being internal or external to one's body matter? It seems like any of these choices will lead to unacceptable conclusions (e.g.: Entities seen through eyeglasses are not observable, etc.)

Overall, I don't see how to employ the observable/non-observable distinction in any useful way. We only ever detect signatures or byproducts; nothing is directly perceivable, so the word 'direct' is meaningless in this context.

43,"Hello ask philosophy.

So over the past couple of months I have been working on theory crafting a personal project that is a series of different interactive pieces that represent a philosophical 'conversation' about Schopenhauer's Wille und Vorstellung. For context each of these pieces would be expected to be released years apart, rather than all at one time.

I'm only really on my second read, plus some audiobook for while I drive, and I think there is certainly a benefit to getting the thoughts of others. Especially anyone who is well versed in the subject matter.

Currently I have three concepts that each piece should address in some way: metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. Mainly my question is what sort of headers/sections would you break metaphysics down to with consideration of being able to lead someone through the conversation such that each piece flows naturally while supporting all other pieces?

For example to me it would seem important to start with more or less attacking the idea that the world is in its entirety as it is perceived, to begin the work of delineation between the human perception of the world and the world as it is without observation (Kant's Thing in Itself). From there recognizing and stepping through the Narrow Door to the Truth. And so on.

And so I ask, what stepping stones would you lead an audience through in this conversation? Especially in the focus on the metaphysics. Do these first two steps seem a solid path or would you alter it? And where might you go from there? If  it helps, think of it like a lecture series with each lecture focusing on a specific step in the 'conversation'.

44,"In the first chapter of _Beyond Good and Evil_, Nietzsche discusses that many philosophers appear to be driven by personal convictions, because of intrinsic biases and that a drive to truth is not the main motivation of many (then contemporary) philosophers. See the following excerpts from the Kaufmann translation: 

Aphorism 3

&gt; ""I have kept a close eye on the philosophers and read between their lines for long enough to say to myself: the greatest part of conscious thought must still be attributed to instinctive activity, and this is even the case for philosophical thought.""

Aphorism 5

&gt; ""They all act as if they had discovered and arrived at their genuine convictions through the self-development of a cold, pure, divinely insouciant dialectic (in contrast to the mystics of every rank, who are more honest than the philosophers and also sillier ‚Äì they talk about ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù ‚Äì): while what essentially happens is that they take a conjecture, a whim, an ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù or, more typically, they take some fervent wish that they have sifted through and made properly abstract ‚Äì and they defend it with rationalizations after the fact. They are all advocates who do not want to be seen as such; for the most part, in fact, they are sly spokesmen for prejudices that they christen as ‚Äútruths‚Äù""

Aphorism 6

&gt; ""I have gradually come to realize what every great philosophy so far has been: a confession of faith on the part of its author, and a type of involuntary and unselfconscious memoir; in short, that the moral (or immoral) intentions in every philosophy constitute the true living seed from which the whole plant has always grown.""

Which is a massively interesting observation, to say the least. One wonders whether Nietzsche is ultimately right here, or whether that is a bit shortsighted. I was wondering if anyone was aware of a more thorough and general treatment of how psychological state of mind (or e.g. things like (academic) status and influence) shape philosophical thought. What I am getting at is that someone more prone to mental states of sadness or despair may shape a more pessimistic philosophy than someone who encountered more positive life experiences (contrast Schopenhauer with Camus).

Is this sentence logically correct? Let's see...


Everyone wants to be strong in this life and their kids  to be even stronger.

What is a good life? 

A good life is asocciated by the majority of the people to be a life with little to no problems, being rich and not struggling at all with anything, not overworking yourself to pay the astronomical cost of living(if you are poor), to be able to buy anything that shows up to your eye (be rich).

Associating good life with becoming weaker and poor life with becoming stronger:



But little do those people understand that what makes people stronger, and what will make their kids stronger, is hardship(meaning: all the things that makes our life difficult) and having a life full of problems. Because in that instance you exercise your ability to think, to find solutions to the problems life throws at you, so your mind becomes stronger. Because of the hardships you also become more resistant because you get used to the bad conditions. For example imagine you are poor and struggling to afford food. If one day you have no food in your house then it's no problem because you are used to hunger anyway. Now compare this scenario with the following one: a rich kid who's used to eat alot and thought out the day, now cut his food supply. These two people the poor and the rich are on living now on the same scenario, they both have no food. The question is: who is more likely to keep his sanity and his brain in contact in this instance.
Answer: the poor kid. Because his stronger, by being used to the bad conditions that no rich kid would be able to survive.
This is why people who work for a better life for their kids and are seeking better living conditions for them are actually shooting their offsprings in their legs, by making them weaker, more passive(because daddy did everything so I don't have to work like he did) irresistant to pain, hunger and having zero tolerance when life throws lemons at them.

The real question is: 
if tolerating pain and solving problems in our life, only makes ourselves stronger then why do so many people choose to avoid pain and hardship and choose an ""easy"" life for themselves and their children AND at the same time want themselves and their kids to be strong

Why is everyone avoiding problems at all costs in their lives instead of embracing them and actually reaping the benefits (become stronger) by solving them.

A quick summary is this: the expected utility of the wager is always infinite, even if you choose to wager against God. 
This is because you would still have an extremely small chance of randomly starting to believe in Him, even if you chose not to believe at first. Now, since any finite number times infinity is infinity, it seems that your expected value is identical to outright wagering for God.

This argument seems to work mathematically, but it sounds intuitively absurd to me. How could a 100% chance of infinite utility have the same expected utility as a 0.1% chance of infinite utility?

61,"This might just be my favorite argument ever, its just so unbelievably clever and quite possibly the argument that is most likely to lead to depression. This is coming from someone who has been a moral anti-realist(throughout my life thus far) despite believing in a God early on in my life. 

Here is how the orignal argument goes. 

No thing can be known with absolute certanity(All knowledge is probability) So to ensure that we increase our probability of being correct we should double-check, triple-check, ask someone else to check, etc('Horizontal'checking). 

The other kind of checking is 'Vertical' where we judge our ability to make judgements about our initial proposition, for eg one if one is tired they are less likely to be correct than if they weren't. 

But that isn't where we should stop, we should further judge our ability to judge our ability. 

This leads to an infinite regress and hence complete abandonment of any certanity. 

My interpretation if this initially was that all probabilities collapse to 0 since an infinite multiplication of non 1 probabilities would lead to 0 probability. To the best of my understanding Hume's point isn't this but that even something like the 4th level of judgement in itself is so unintuitive and near impossible to comprehend(to me I can't even comprehend the 3rd level). Hence there exists a massive amount of uncertanity about essentially all our beliefs. 

The only valid objection to this argument wod be to flip the orignal premise to say that that in itself can't be true based on the conclusion(cause no thing including P1 can't be known with absolute certanity). 

To defeat this objection I changed the orignal premise to 'Almost all things can't be known with absolute certanity' hence the conclusion is 'Almost all things are known with a probability of 0', which maybe slightly weaker but it essentially leads to the same 'wasteland'. 

For those of you who would say that accepting that the updated premise as one of those few things which isn't known with absolute certanity is a tough pill to swallow. Which whilst it may strike as a good defence to some feels like a complete missing the point of the argument. 

Even if one replaces 'Almost everything' with any individual premise(literally anyone you choose) would have probability 0 or basically 0. So I don't think there is any escaping this argument. 

Hume's own response to this was that whilst the argument is rationally perfectly sound judging at the 6th level is just so unintuitive and unnatural that it can't be done . There is a very good reason why we have evolved the way we have. 

This alongside Plantinga's EAAN (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism#:~:text=Plantinga%20argues%20that%20combining%20naturalism,that%20several%20thinkers%2C%20including%20C.%20S.) Lead to complete blackholes even for a theist.


Honestly apart from Descartes' 'Something thinking exists' I can't think of any statenent with any certanity. This to me leads to a complete rational blackhole where the only way out to just swallow the pill and say we must only consider the first 2 levels of judgement(which in itself is an irrational thing to do) to even maintain any form of rational argumentation.

**Q. When does the absence of evidence count as evidence of absence?** 

My answer (so far): In cases where evidence would be expected if it were present.

(*Please*, *explain further from here on where I left off*.)

**! Explain** how saying ‚Äú*the absence of evidence implies evidence of absence*‚Äù commits the argument from ignorance fallacy.

Does claiming ‚Äú*the absence of evidence implies evidence of absence*‚Äù necessarily commit the argument from ignorance fallacy, or are there exceptions in which this claim is not fallacious? 

Explain how one can determine whether the claim ‚Äú*the absence of evidence implies evidence of absence*‚Äù is fallacious. How can one delineate the cases in which the claim is fallacious from cases in which it is not fallacious?

***The Argument from Ignorance:***

¬∑ To accept that X is true because X has not (*yet*) been proven false 

(i.e., falsified: i.e., confirmed as (being) false).

¬∑ To accept that X is false because X has not (*yet*) been proven true

(i.e., verified: i.e., confirmed as (being) true).

To conclude that X is true from the mere fact that it has not or cannot be proven false is to commit a logical fallacy called: ‚Äú*The Argument from Ignorance*.‚Äù 

Likewise, to conclude that X is false from the mere fact that it has not or cannot be proven true is also to commit the same fallacy. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is my attempt at answering my own question...**

&amp;#x200B;

**Absence of Evidence ‚áè**  **Evidence of Absence**

 **Given:** 

**A1: ‚Äú**There is ***no*** evidence of some object **‚Äò**d1**‚Äô** named **‚Äò**c1**‚Äô** existing**.**‚Äù

**B1: ‚Äú**There is ***some*** evidence of some object **‚Äò**d1**‚Äô** named **‚Äò**c1**‚Äô not** existing**.‚Äù**

***The latter (B1) implies the former (A1) but not vice versa:***

¬∑ **P1: = \[**A1 -/-&gt;B1**\]: A1** does not imply **B1.**

¬∑ **P2: = \[**B1 --&gt; A1**\]** : **B1** implies **A1.**

It is an *argument from ignorance* fallacy to conclude that something is absent from the mere fact that its presence has not or cannot be demonstrated. 

The absence of evidence of the presence of something is not proof of its absence. The absence of evidence for something can be evidence that it is absent only in cases  where evidence would be expected if that thing were actually present. Failing to adequately investigate for the presence of something cannot be sufficient grounds to conclude it is absent and doing so would be fallacious. 

Having proof (i.e., sufficient evidence constituting proof) of the absence of something implies not having proof of its presence. However, the converse (i.e., reverse direction) of this implication does not hold. Evidence of absence implies absence of evidence; however, the converse is not the case: namely, the absence of evidence does not imply evidence of absence. That is, not having proof of the presence of something does not imply having proof of the absence of that thing. Likewise, not having proof of the absence of something does not imply having proof of the presence of that thing.

To assert that ""absence of evidence is proof of absence"" is to commit a logical fallacy called the argument from ignorance whereby ""something is concluded to be absent because it has not (yet) been proven to be present,"" or ""something is concluded to be present because it has not (yet) been proven to be absent.""

To orient our discussion my professor showed us 4 pictures; one of a fetus, a woman in a vegetative state, a dog, and Siri. We split into small groups and the person that led our group said that essentially a person was someone who could react to their emotions. So she concluded that the dog was the only person in the pictures.

106," I thought of an ‚Äúargument from existentialism‚Äù which relates to the idea of ‚Äúevidence‚Äù/‚Äúburden of proof‚Äù, with regards to the idea of God (god-questions and claims about god). Does it stand up philosophically? 

As you probably know, there are various claims and arguments concerning the evidence and the burden of proof when it comes to the god- question. we have the theological arguments, and then we have Russell‚Äôs teapot etc.

The idea I'm talking about is slightly different that those. I thought of an ‚Äúargument from existentialism‚Äù. 

It basically boils down to this- can someone hold a position (for example, that there is no god), and also hold a position that rational defense is unnecessary? What sort of burden of proof would this person have and why?

As a preamble, let me just say that my thinking was influenced by atheist existentialists, like Camus, Nietzsche, and Satre, who basically claim atheism as an ‚Äúexistential viewpoint‚Äù. as in, they claim that they exist as an atheist, (Nietzsche mentions ‚Äúatheist by instinct‚Äù in one of his books), Camus‚Äôs protagonist in the Stranger basically just rejects theism because it doesn‚Äôt interest him etc. My thinking was also influenced by Chinese philosophy (like Taoism, and Confucianism), which don‚Äôt have strong god-claims at all, and other non-theist philosophies (like zen and buddhism). 

Nietzsche, Camus and Satre made lots of claims about god and the universe. but they didn‚Äôt really use any evidence. most of their claims are just assertions. But they are accepted as good philosophers. Similarly, Zen Buddhists, Taoists, etc. also dismiss god-claims off hand. but they don‚Äôt engage with the god-claims, they just dismiss them. and again, zen and taoism is considered philosophically legitimate. 

It basically boils down to this- can someone hold a position (for example, that there is no god), and also hold a position that rational defense is unnecessary? 

The argument just basically goes like this-

The starting point is one human being that ‚Äúexists‚Äù as an atheist. 

This particular person that is an atheist by instinct or choice. They make a claim like ‚ÄúI believe there are no Gods‚Äù. i.e. is more of a belief claim than an empirical claim. The exact opposite to ‚ÄúI believe that there‚Äôs a god‚Äù. ( ‚ÄúI believe there is no God‚Äù). 

Does this person have a ‚Äúburden of proof‚Äù? To this person, all God question or god claims are so abstract to this person, that they can be dismissed just on the basis of being too abstract. Just like a Zen buddhist, who has the goal of ‚Äúno thought‚Äù, would would basically dismiss any abstract thought. 

Or, you could explain it like this. a child, or an animal, that ‚Äúexists‚Äù as an atheist (without any theological thoughts) are not expected to defend their ‚Äúatheism‚Äù. So why do any adult human beings, that exist as an atheist, have to ‚Äúdefend‚Äù their atheism? If atheists do have a budder of proof to the theist, at what age does this obligation kick in? 

My argument would be that this type of person doesn‚Äôt have a burden of proof. What do you think? Does this person have a ‚Äúburden of proof‚Äù? What sort of burden of proof would they have? 

What is the history of the idea of ‚Äúburden of proof‚Äù, who first came up with idea? I was thinking that this might help. But I have had trouble sourcing it. The only thing I can think of, is that the idea of ‚Äúburden of proof‚Äù was invented by some Latin or Greek philosophers (possibly Aristotle), which is in itself an epistemological assertion, which hasn‚Äôt been proven. 

So can someone hold a position (for example, that there is no god), and also hold a position that rational defense is unnecessary? 

I mean, it seems like the idea that someone needs to defend their epistemological position, is ALSO an epistemological position. 

I mean, can someone hold an epistemological position (for example, that there is no god), and also hold an epistemological position that rational defense is unnecessary? Philosophies like Taoism, zen and absurdism reject rationally entirely. Or at least they don‚Äôt think that it necessarily points to truth.","Can someone hold an epistemological position (for example, that there is no god), and also hold a position that rational defense is unnecessary?

What I mean is - modern historians are particularly concerned to oppose ""traditional"" histories, the kinds that focused on kings and their lives, warfare, big important dates, political systems and their civilizational import etc. That is, there is always a concern to show that, say, archeological findings on ancient Greece or Rome fundamentally alter how we should conceive of these societies.

When I'm reading, say, a 19th century german philosopher, there is frequently a wealth of references to the kinds of historical narratives which were prevalent at the time - lots of takes on Roman emperors and what they did, the campaigns of Napoleon, the policies and laws introduced in Britain, France and Prussia etc. Basically, The history of your old-school, bourgeois erudite in the West.

133,"Hi, I'm a bit of an eccentric who teaches my brand of philosophy, spirituality, and mental health here on Reddit. I normally call myself a transcendental post-zen alchemist, mainly for marketing reasons, but recently, as I've been mass posting to reach people who might like my content, I've been getting some comments telling me I'm this or I'm that, and it got me curious as to what category(s) of philosophy I might fit in. I confess, due to mental disabilities, I stopped my formal studies of philosophy years ago, and the medication I'm on makes it a chore to read lengthy texts, so I ask you forgive me for asking such a basic question here. I'm just going to spill my beliefs and give insight with my story, and if anyone opts to read what I'm sharing, I'll be grateful for any inputs you have.

Alright, the core of my beliefs is centered around the idea that free will is a skill. It seems obvious to me that if you walk down a new road everyday, eventually you'll be able to navigate to any destination. In other words, your harvest depends on what you plant. This means, because the devil known as entropy is constantly licking our heels, that we each have a duty to invest in ourselves, so we can grow the garden at our feet and assist others with the fruits of our labors. 

Now, this comes with a caveat: if the gardener does not take care of themselves, who takes care of the garden? Our first love must be self-love, but this is not a call for selfishness. Truly, kindness, compassion, and selfless service must be paramount in our society if we are to thrive. In other words, love, which I interpret to mean ""always do the supererogatory while being kind to the tamed flesh."" As such, I believe in the importance of selflessness, but as John Nash mathematically proved with game theory and governing dynamics, there exists a ratio of giving to the self and giving to the whole that maximizes the growth of the self and the growth of the whole. This means there is a time to give and a time to receive, and we being masters of ourselves must discern that ratio in real time, using our senses and intuition to know what time it is at any given moment, being honest with ourselves and friends.

This naturally leads to trying to develop a game plan for your life. Knowing what we do about developmental and behavioral psychology, it becomes paramount that we take serious our personal growth with regards to our personal limitations and boundaries. As a vine grapples with its environment, looking for something to cling to to in order to pull it up, we must consciously try to craft experiences that grow us into our best selves.

Now a metaphor: the mind is like a pile of sand. Every grain is an experience we have had, with a constant stream of sand always falling on top. Now, we can perturb the outside of this pile easily, but the inner core, or our personality, is tough and slow to move. That's why we must give ourselves routine novel and profound experiences to shake all we know loose.

This is what a pilgrimage used to do. By traveling far and continuously reintegrating into foreign communities, you learned the relativity of your own operating system. Now, we can't really do this in the modern day, but we can still travel to different cultures to get a jolting experience. Likewise, we can simulate the trials of the journey by continuously learning new skills and languages, which increase neuroplasticity. Making and consuming art is another way to loosen the ego's grip on your mind. And the last thing I will simply mention are psychedelics, which have a good track record for expanding one's consciousness.

Now, I will tell you that I was once a very broken woman. Plagued with schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type), autism, ADHD, PTSD, social anxiety and more than one cluster b personality disorder, I felt hopeless after I had to leave college. I collapsed into a pit of despair, but something in me refused to give up. After a powerful acid trip, I decided I would learn to juggle and at least fix my social anxiety through exposure therapy. I did that, and in six months I went out and juggled in public. Starting completely terrified, I soon learned there was nothing to fear. I kept it up for years, eventually branching out to other performance arts.

A couple years passed. Another acid trip got me to believe that joining this environmental nonprofit across the country was a good idea. Well, turns out they were a cult. I'll save you the details, but I was effectively brainwashed into becoming a willing slave working sixty hours a week for no pay. Sounds like hell right? Well, it honestly wasn't that bad. See, they gradually rolled me out into the position I was in. Like a frog that doesn't jump out of water that's slowly brought to a boil, I learned that I was far more capable than I thought I was. I devoted myself to my spiritual growth for several months before deciding I could do better than this.

That's when I decided to become voluntarily homeless. I was out there on the concrete for three years. There were bad moments, sure, but I got used to them, and I never stopped trying to improve myself. I would pick up trash, exercise, network, write, juggle, and do performance arts on a daily basis, all while living out of trash cans. It was hard, but I was harder. Still, it pushed me so far out of my comfort zone that I couldn't help but change. And when I did finally get comfortable, I would pick up and ride a bus across the country to start over in a new city with only a backpack to my name.

It was a little extreme, but I cannot emphasize how much better I am in every regard. I'm more socialized, more kind, more skillful, more moral, and I have more willpower than ever. Likewise, my cluster b personality disorders have disappeared, and the bipolar aspect of my schizoaffective disorder has been mitigated greatly. I'm happy now, and things keep looking up, and I want to teach this wisdom I have gained.

So, that's the abridged version of myself and my philosophy. I'm writing a book to tell my tale and to teach the importance of unconditional love. But, that's still a ways down the line still. In the present, it would please me to know what I could be categorized as. I'm still going to call myself a transcendental post-zen alchemist, but knowing what I relate to will only further assist in my ability to market myself. Thank you if you've read all this.

Since none of their actions can repay whatever societal debt they've incurred, they would have no incentive to make attempts to repay that debt. As a result, those with societal debt should always have some opportunity for redemption, even if it is not a total absolution of some wrong, at least some progress.

However, I also heavily suspect that there is a limit beyond which acts incur a debt so large they cannot be repaid in the lifetime of the actor or that in the actor's remaining time they could not be convinced to stop committing further wrong acts. Acts of genocide commited by a man with is days from his deathbed and staunch in their beliefs, for example.

How should people across that line be treated, if the line gets drawn at all?

This doesn't really make sense though as how can one acknowledge something as subjective (grounded on conscious/indivdual/subjective thought) while at the same time believe it to be true? 

We often also completely deny our own opinions, for example one might say ""In my opinions vanilla is better than chocolate"" and then completely deny his ""belief"" by saying that it is not objectively true that vanilla is indeed better than chocolate. But on the other side, we can have opinions that we regard as objectively true, for example - ""In my opinion right to abortion should be a basic right"".

165,"# Valid Deductive Arguments with Contradictory Premises

Help me understand how contradictory premises can make an argument deductively valid \[Discussion\]. Explain how the argument {P1, P2 | C} is valid given that premises P1 and P2 contradict? How come this is so? Explain in detail! Please discuss my attempted and proposed solution.

**Given** a sylogism with two premises (P1 and P2) and a conclusion (C): {P1, P2 | C}.

How does the contradiction between premises P1 and P2 (i.e., \[P1 &amp; P2\]) make the argument

{P1, P2 | C} valid?

**Please explain in detail how contradictory premises can make an argument valid...**

Here is my attempt to answer my own question...

An argument is deductively valid if and only if it is impossible for (all) the premises to be true yet the conclusion false.

**So, we devise a validity test:**

i. Assume all the premises true: P1 \^ P2

ii. Make the conclusion false (i.e., negate the conclusion: \~C).

**!** Take the premises to be true and negate conclusion\*\*:\*\*

¬∑ If a contradiction arises, the argument is valid.

¬∑ If no contradiction arises, the argument is invalid.

Applying the ***validity test*** to show that an argument **{P1, P2 | C}** is **valid**:

**i.e.,** P1 and P2 entail C: **{P1, P2} |= C**

**Testing for validity‚Ä¶**

1. **A** *contradiction* arises as a result of step \[i\] of the validity test because the premises are contradictory
2. **No** *contradiction* arises as a result of step \[ii\] of the validity test because the premises being true does not contradict the conclusion being false.

**3.** **A** *contradiction* arises: namely that one both arises **(1)** and does not arise **(2).**

4. Therefore, the argument is **valid.**

We assume the premises true (P1 \^ P2) and the conclusion false (\~C). If a contradiction arises, then it is an indication that the argument is in such a form that would make it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Therefore, the argument is valid. If our assuming the premises true and the conclusion false leads to a contradiction, then our assumption that ‚Äúthe premises can be true and the conclusion false‚Äù is false. Therefore, the premises cannot be true while the conclusion false, and therefore the argument is **valid.**

If, however, our assumptions do not yield a contradiction, then it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Therefore, the argument is **invalid.**

It is impossible for the conjunction P1 &amp; P2 to be true because they are contradictory:

P1 = X\*\*,\*\* P2 = \~X; \[P1 &amp; P2\] = f, where **f**: falsum, which stands for a contradiction

If (P1 &amp; P2) yields a contradiction, the argument is valid because it is impossible for both premises to be true and the conclusion false (\~C).

As the premises cannot be true, they also cannot be true while the conclusion being false.

So, if negating the conclusion (\~C) contradicts the premises both being true (P1 &amp; P2), then the argument is valid.

I know that I have correctly applied the validity test. I know that this explanation works, but I need understanding why this is so. Please, explain in depth, from where I left off, why it is that a contradictory premises can make an argument valid, and whether this hold regardless of whether the conclusion is true or not.","Q.

1. There's no same self persisting over time (mind, bodyl)
2. There is never a self in first person experience
3. There is no thinker of thoughts
4. There is no locus of control or attention that exercises free will

182,"Can symbols such as *P*, *Q*, *A*, *B*... in propositional calculus hold any linguistic meanings?  

For example, in first-order logic, we can give the formula T(a) the meaning ""a is a tree"" or ""a has the property of being a tree"". That's a linguistic meaning. Can *P* in propositional calculus have a meaning such as ""Anna is a planet""?  

My mental consensus now, after researching this a lot, is that symbols such as *P* in propositional calculus can only hold *two very specific meanings*:  

1. the pure abstract concept of a true proposition.  

2. the pure abstract concept of a false proposition.  

I think that's the case because, when we give an interpretation to propositional calculus, the interpretation is basically just assigning truth values to symbols.  

But when we give an interpretation to first-order logic, we actually give meanings to the predicates such as verbs, adjectives... The interpretation is not just assigning truth values to symbols, it's actually giving them linguistic meanings (similar to our language).

Compossibility.

Origin Uniqueness. 
It is impossible that a single table¬†x is originally made from matter¬†y¬†and in addition is originally made from matter¬†z.


Sufficiency. 
If it is possible that a table¬†x‚Ä≤¬†is the¬†nth¬†table originally made from matter¬†z¬†according to plan¬†uu¬†while no table is made from matter that only partially overlaps¬†z, then necessarily any table that is the¬†nth¬†table originally made from matter¬†z according to plan¬†u¬†while no table is made from matter that only partially overlaps¬†z is the very table¬†x‚Ä≤ and no other.


Therefore,

At one place, somewhere in the first chapter, Stephen was describing the importance of principles. He distinguished it from values. Values are subjective. A group of thieves, too, has values that are shared between them. But principles are more than that. They are fundamental and objective laws, which are self-evident truths. There is no subjectivity to them. Quoting another, he says that it is impossible to break these laws, one can only break himself against the law. 

Identification, objectivity and veracity of these principles, the author states, can be tested easily. They are self evident. Nobody can or would want to build their character, relationships and profession on the opposites of what these principles stipulate. For e.g., who would align himself with unfairness, deceit, uselessness and hatred, and expect to rise towards a happier and more effective living? One can barely argue against these fundamental principles. 

As I read it with agreement, I realised that despite my understanding and belief that unfairness and deceit are principally at loggerheads with a good life.

I find these two notions - the self-evidentary truth of fairness and honesty, and my observation about utlity of unfairness and deceit - contradictorily in my mind.

They ‚Äúclaim‚Äù that they didn‚Äôt understand me at the time but they have a better idea now, and they ‚Äúclaim‚Äù that nothing they do will ever make things okay, but they want me to know how ‚Äúsorry‚Äù they are.

I told each of them to fuck off, and to take their apology and to shove it up their ass.

Reddit did not like that. Reddit doesn‚Äôt understand that bigotry is unforgivable. Period. You don‚Äôt deserve a second chance once you‚Äôve established yourself as a homophobe or a racist. You don‚Äôt deserve forgiveness. You deserve to live with that guilt for the rest of your life. You deserve to be hated for the rest of your life. You don‚Äôt get a do-over.

Forgiving someone for being bigoted in their past spits in the faces of the victims of their past bigotry. Forgiveness is largely pointless. You can‚Äôt change the past, you can‚Äôt undo the damage you‚Äôve caused, you can‚Äôt make anything better. So what‚Äôs the point? Forgiveness only perpetuates bigotry and intolerance. We should not allow people guilty of bigotry to absolve themselves of this. They don‚Äôt deserve it.

If someone is caught being homophobic or bigoted, they deserve to be hated and ridiculed for the rest of their life. No redemption, no second chances, they should be canceled forever. People don‚Äôt change. Fuck forgiveness. Forgiveness is completely pointless.

Although this method has been helpful to Western medicine, it still has several shortcomings. Reductionism simply puts a band aid on a wound, that will likely break open again... and¬†doctors continue to explain medical terms at a microscopic level without taking the patient's comprehension into account.

1,"Hi, I am presently listening to these [series of lectures](https://oyc.yale.edu/death/phil-176), in [22nd lecture](https://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-22) the lecturer talks about whether we should fear death. I found this lecture to be very confusing and was hoping that perhaps you guys could help clear things up for me. The lecturer doesn't spend any time on presenting a framework for the metaphysics of emotions and I believe this is the core of my confusion.

I will outline how I view emotions and what exactly I found confusing  
A. Each emotion takes a particular shape. In a sense that if I know that there is a bad thing that is going to happen to me what I feel (fear) is different than what I feel when I have done better on an exam than everyone else (pride).  
B. The description of this unique shape can be understood as the criteria necessary for this emotion to arise. For example, if I don't believe that something bad is going to happen then I cannot feel fear because that is an integral part of what fear entails/the shape of fear.  
C. If I feel a particular emotion then by definition I have met the necessary criteria to feel said emotion, otherwise I wouldn't be able to feel said emotion in the first place.  
D. From one's own perspective it is always sensible to feel what they feel.  
For example, I may believe that there is a 90% chance that aliens will abduct me and carry out horrible experiments on me. If this is the reality I believe then it absolutely makes sense to feel fear. We may however argue that my belief about the facts of the world, that there is a 90% chance of being kidnapped is false. If someone then convinces me that there is only 10\^(-100) probability to be kidnapped by aliens my fear then automatically seizes because the way I view facts of the world do produce an arisal of fear.

Kagan in the lecture starts by establishing the criteria for under which feeling fear makes sense.  
i. Something bad needs to be happening.  
ii. The probability of the bad thing happening needs to be not negligible.

iii. The magnitude and probability of the bad thing happening cannot entail certainty. (We should not known how bad the bad thing is exactly going to be and the probability of the bad thing happening should not be a 100%)  
\&gt; This is where the confusion for me arises. Kagan positions a third criteria for fear which makes me confused about what Kagan really meant when he was talking previously.

Was he talking about:

iiiA. By listing the three criteria of fear Kagan was describing what fear entails, i.e. listing the criteria necessary for an emotion of fear to arise. In which case I would argue criteria iii. is not necessary. I think we all have felt fear when we knew how bad the bad thing is going to be and that it will definitely happen. For example, when I was a child and broke a vase I knew that my parents will 100% discover that I broke the vase when they come back home and I knew exactly what the punishment is going to be, but I still felt this same emotion which I feel when there is uncertainty whether the bad thing is going to occur, fear. How can this be reconciled?

iiiB. By listing the three criteria for fear Kagan was not describing what the fear entails, i.e. listing the criteria necessary for an emotion to arise, but was listing the criteria under which it is reasonable, to quote Kagan - ""it makes sense"", to feel fear. If this was what Kagan meant, then on what grounds can it be established that what we feel is ever unreasonable/""doesn't make sense""?  
I think the two first criteria were describing what fear entails/the shape of fear/the necessary criteria for fear to arise. But on what grounds can Kagan then introduce an additional criteria to say that it is only then reasonable to feel fear. It is something akin to saying there is a criteria F for a car to drive. When we observe a car driving then criteria F has to have been met, otherwise the car wouldn't drive. But then Kagan says, no, for a car to drive it needs to drive at least at a 100km per hour, so the criteria is F+100km/h. This seems false, because we know that when a car drives only criteria F has to be met. And then also, further, on what grounds can one add an additional criteria, others may say for a car to drive it needs to drive at 120km or 60km, or it needs to fly, etc.  
The analogy with a car is imperfect, so I will also give another example. On what grounds could anyone say our laws of physics do not make sense/are unreasonable? The only reasonableness condition for our laws of physics is that they are the way they are and therefore they are reasonable/sensible.

While the person they were speaking to (representing some version of utilitarianism) would agree to a person sacrificing themselves to save billions.

8,"So I have not read the original paper 'on what there is'. I am currentyl reading an introduction to metphysics by Alyssa Ney. In the first chapter she discusses what we mean when we say something doesn't exist and she mainly does this by quoting and paraphrasing Quine's position on this view. So Quine argues against two possible answers to the question of what we mean when we say that something doesn't exist, sentences such as: Pegasus does not exist, or, Santa Claus does not exist. He labels these possible opponents as McX and Wyman, who have two different answers.

McX views non existent entities as ideas in the mind. He says that Santa Claus and Pegasus are ideas in the mind, not concrete objects that exists somewhere in the world. Pegasus is not a live physical horse with wings but idea of of a horse with wings.

Quine disagrees witht this because  what we are concerned about are Pegasus and Santa Claus, not the idea of them. The sentences 'Pegasus doesn't exist' and 'Santa Claus doesn't exist' are true. But of course the ideas of Pegasus and Santa Claus exist. It is rather Pegasus (the flying horse) and Santa Claus (the jolly man carrying presents) who do not, So the view of McX must be wrong.

And I completely agree with this objection, however, I don't really see his point when it comes to Wyman

Wyman says: Pegasus, Santa Clause, and other non-existent entities are ""unactualized possibles"". They are just like any other entity, except they lack the properties of actuality and existence. Pegasus is a physical horse with wings, just not one that actually exists in space and time.

&amp;#x200B;

Quine's objection to this view is that Wyman is distorting the meaning of the word ""exists"". Because according to Wyman, when we say that Pegasus and Santa Claus don't exist, we aren't saying that there aren't such entities (is he though?). Instead, we are only saying saying that these entities are among the group of merely possible things, things that are possible but not actual. In doing so, Wyman is understnading existence as a property only of actually existing things. There is a wider class on of entities that have being, that are, he says (I don't understand what this means). Those entities that exist, on the other hand, are only those that are actual. Quine's objection to the view that nonexistent entities are unactualized possibles involves rejection of the distinction between being on one hand and existence on the other. As quoted directly from quine apparantly ""Wyman is one of those philosophers who have united in ruining the good old word 'exist' ... We have all been prone to say, in our common-sense usage of 'exist', that pegasus does not exist, meaning simply that there is no such entity at all"".

Obviously Quine must understand Wyman's point since he himself conjured him, however, I don't really see Quine's point though. Where in Wymans view did Wyman create a distinction between the words ""being"" and ""existence""? What about the view of seeing non-existent entities as unactualized possibilities necessitates drawing a distinction of the words ""existence"" and ""being"". Consider these three sentences: 

Unicorns could be but they are not. 

Unicorns have a possibility of existing but they do not actually exist. 

Unicorns could be real but they are not as they are merely possible but no actual.

All these sentences say the same thing, it's just paraphrased. All of these sentences seem compatible with Wymans view that non-existent entities are unactualized possibilities. So why is Quine saying that this view forces a disctinction between ""being"" and existence"" when they could be interchangable in sentences like this without intefering with Wyman's view? These unactualized possibilites do not have being and are not part of Wymans Ontology since they aren't real or existing, only possible. They do not have being, but could have had. They do not exist but only had the possibility of existing. They aren't real but possibly could've been. Or that's at least how I would think about it. Or am I missing something?

I see words as authorities - sources of power for which each item in the sentence is something one needs to 'defend' against with their own set of authorities like explanations or understanding. If a sentence is too difficult to interpret, your set of authorities wasn't able to withstand the 'attack', so you need to retrain (be critical) to then understand what's going on to then understand it or maybe use it without understanding it.

For example, in the prior sentence, the word 'so' is one of those words that isn't particularly one to be critical against, so it holds a lot of power and is an unquestioning authority.

17,"Can anyone recommend any reading on the more philosophical questions raised specifically about the necessity of observers/measurement for the collapse of wave functions? And what 'observer' means?

Specifically, so you know what sort of thing I'm interested in, I've been wondering the following:

(I think this is correct, but I'm not a physicist so could be wrong.) Quantum physics tells us that a probabilistic wave function can collapse into a definite event when it is measured. Traditionally this was understood as ""It only becomes definite once observed (by a conscious entity),"" but it's since been understood as ""It only becomes definite once measured, i.e., once the wave function is interacted with in a particular way by something physical"".

There are three things I'm interested in regarding this:

1. What is the 'particular way' that a wave function has to be interacted with for it to collapse into something concrete?
2. How do we know that it's measurement, and not observation of said measurement, that collapses it?
3. (This is where the philosophy comes into it, and is what I'm most interested in.) Could it not be argued that what defines 'measurement' is a product of human understanding anyway? If we take physical reality 'on its own terms,' so to speak, then all that there is is physical things or processes (or both). A thermometer, taking physical reality on its own terms and only its own terms, is no more than a particular substance in a tube that expands when it heats up. Thinking purely physically, it's not a 'measurement' at all -- it's just there, and it does what it does. It's only when we add *human interpretation* into the picture that it becomes a 'measurement'. Reality under a purely physical description doesn't include interpretation, rather physical reality is something that can be interpreted from outside of the physical framework (which is *not* to say that this interpretive framework cannot be causally explained by such a physical reality -- I'm not taking an anti-physicalist stance -- it's just to say that the notion of an interpretive framework at all is not *describable* in terms of the physical, though it might be *causally explainable* in terms of the physical.) I'm sure all that I've just said is contestable, but this is just to explain the topic that's interested me. Specifically, I was wondering if there are any readings discussing the philosophical problem/topic of interpretation/measurement as I've described it as it applies to the measurement of the collapse of quantum wave functions. In other words, readings that discuss the question: How can we understand what it is that collapses a wave function in purely phyiscal terms (i.e. as a physical interaction) if what defines what it is that can collapse these functions is not describable in purely physical terms? Without a conscious interpreter, it might be argued that the notion of 'measurement' doesn't exist, and therefore even if the wave function's collapse isn't ascribed to 'observation' but only to 'measurement', such an explanation is still, nevertheless, related (in some way -- which way in particular is what I want to read about) to conscious interpretation. Or, another question, expressed in Einsteinian metaphor: Why would God choose to make X what collapses a wave function, if X is only practically distinguishable from Y and Z (other random physical interactions) to interpreters?",Recommended reading on quantum observers/measurement?,askphilosophy

#There are no truths
 Let me clarify what I mean when I say we don't have truths, I mean more that we only have our senses, but our senses aren't reality. Much less true, yet we need them for survival. For all we know we could be wrong about everything, that's not to say objective reality doesn't exist. Just that we can't necessarily rely on our senses to determine them, so we need some tool that goes beyond our senses.


#how predictability relates to truth 

Predictability is a great tool for determining truth (because we couldn't otherwise have known), and if you can't predict truths nothing can possibly be true. Because something that's unpredictable is not consistent, and truth has to be consistent.
Things that are objectively real, act real, and are predictable. If we can predict truths, truth therefore must exist. (Math is a good example of predictable objective reality)

He goes on: 
‚ÄúIf one basic principle elucidates so many

35,"‚áî is a logical connective symbol that denotes a 'material biconditional'. It has this truth table:  

A B A ‚áî B

It basically says that A and B have the same truth value. When (A ‚áî B) is a tautology, that is, a statement that is always logically true by virtue of logical form alone (no content or context), then when we say that it's a 'logical equivalence'.  

Picture a logical statement like this:  

(3) ‚áî (1 + 2) ‚áî (1 + 1 + 1)  

It's intuitive to think that this is stating that three propositions have the same truth value. But that's not what is says.  

Indeed, what it claims is: ""exactly one or exactly three of these propositions are true"". This expression indeed allows exactly two of them to be true, and one of them to be false (if you run the truth tables).

40,"Hi, I am presently listening to these [series of lectures](https://oyc.yale.edu/death/phil-176), in [22nd lecture](https://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-22) the lecturer talks about whether we should fear death. I found this lecture to be very confusing and was hoping that perhaps you guys could help clear things up for me. The lecturer doesn't spend any time on presenting a framework for the metaphysics of emotions and I believe this is the core of my confusion. 

I will outline how I view emotions and what exactly I found confusing  
A. Each emotion takes a particular shape. In a sense that if I know that there is a bad thing that is going to happen to me what I feel (fear) is different than what I feel when I have done better on an exam than everyone else (pride).   
B. The description of this unique shape can be understood as the criteria necessary for this emotion to arise. For example, if I don't believe that something bad is going to happen then I cannot feel fear because that is an integral part of what fear entails/the shape of fear.  
C. If I feel a particular emotion then by definition I have met the necessary criteria to feel said emotion, otherwise I wouldn't be able to feel said emotion in the first place.   
D. From one's own perspective it is always sensible to feel what they feel.   
For example, I may believe that there is a 90% chance that aliens will abduct me and carry out horrible experiments on me. If this is the reality I believe then it absolutely makes sense to feel fear. We may however argue that my belief about the facts of the world, that there is a 90% chance of being kidnapped is false. If someone then convinces me that there is only 10\^(-100) probability to be kidnapped by aliens my fear then automatically seizes because the way I view facts of the world do produce an arisal of fear.  


Kagan in the lecture starts by establishing the criteria for under which feeling fear makes sense.   
i. Something bad needs to be happening.  
ii. The probability of the bad thing happening needs to be not negligible.

iii. The magnitude and probability of the bad thing happening cannot entail certainty. (We should not known how bad the bad thing is exactly going to be and the probability of the bad thing happening should not be a 100%)  
\&gt; This is where the confusion for me arises. Kagan positions a third criteria for fear which makes me confused about what Kagan really meant when he was talking previously.   


Was he talking about:

iiiA. By listing the three criteria of fear Kagan was describing what fear entails, i.e. listing the criteria necessary for an emotion of fear to arise. In which case I would argue criteria iii. is not necessary. I think we all have felt fear when we knew how bad the bad thing is going to be and that it will definitely happen. For example, when I was a child and broke a vase I knew that my parents will 100% discover that I broke the vase when they come back home and I knew exactly what the punishment is going to be, but I still felt this same emotion which I feel when there is uncertainty whether the bad thing is going to occur, fear. How can this be reconciled? 

iiiB. By listing the three criteria for fear Kagan was not describing what the fear entails, i.e. listing the criteria necessary for an emotion to arise, but was listing the criteria under which it is reasonable, to quote Kagan - ""it makes sense"", to feel fear. If this was what Kagan meant, then on what grounds can it be established that what we feel is ever unreasonable/""doesn't make sense""?  
I think the two first criteria were describing what fear entails/the shape of fear/the necessary criteria for fear to arise. But on what grounds can Kagan then introduce an additional criteria to say that it is only then reasonable to feel fear. It is something akin to saying there is a criteria F for a car to drive. When we observe a car driving then criteria F has to have been met, otherwise the car wouldn't drive. But then Kagan says, no, for a car to drive it needs to drive at least at a 100km per hour, so the criteria is F+100km/h. This seems false, because we know that when a car drives only criteria F has to be met. And then also, further, on what grounds can one add an additional criteria, others may say for a car to drive it needs to drive at 120km or 60km, or it needs to fly, etc.   
The analogy with a car is imperfect, so I will also give another example. On what grounds could anyone say our laws of physics do not make sense/are unreasonable? The only reasonableness condition for our laws of physics is that they are the way they are and therefore they are reasonable/sensible.

42,"I was just reading the SEP page on Anselm and the section on his ontological proof, and I feel like I must either be missing something important to the framing of the problem, or his ontological proof isn't convincing at all. The SEP page gives two interpretations of the proof. In the first (which the author rejects), I understand the proof to basically go like this:  
\`God is that than which a greater cannot be thought. Once this exists in understanding, we can see that it must really exist, because it would be greater for it to really exist than to simply exist in understanding.\`  
The SEP page considers this the more popular rendering and easily contradicted by Gaunilo who walks us through the same proof but with ""the greatest conceivable island"" instead.They also present this as the more correct and more difficult challenge to atheism:  


1. That than which a greater cannot be thought can be thought.
2. If that than which a greater cannot be thought can be thought, it exists in reality.

Therefore,

3. That than which a greater cannot be thought exists in reality.

""Once we have formed this idea of that than which a greater cannot be thought, Anselm says, we can see that such a being has features that cannot belong to a possible but non-existent object ‚Äì or, in other words, that (2) is true. For example, a being that is capable of non-existence is less great than a being that exists necessarily. If that than which a greater cannot be thought does not exist, it is obviously capable of non-existence; and if it is capable of non-existence, then even if it were to exist, it would not be that than which a greater cannot be thought after all. So if that than which a greater cannot be thought can be thought ‚Äì that is, if it is a possible being ‚Äì it actually exists. (This reading of the argument of the Proslogion is developed at length in Visser and Williams 2008, chapter 5.)""

I don't understand how this defense of (2) isn't exactly the same as the earlier formulation. ""If that than which a greater cannot be thought does not exist, it is obviously capable of non-existence"", and therefor, it doesn't exist. It would be greater, surely, if it did exist, but we can conceive of it existing, while also knowing that it does not.

Then Scott Soames says that (i) Russel here takes Scott to be a logically proper name (why?) and (ii) that on this reading, we can say that George has gone mad and is really wondering about the law of identity, but if we want to retain the primary occurence reading without concluding that George has gone mad, we could treat Scott as a description rather than a logically proper name. How would the logical form look if we take Scott to be a description? and why would that stop us from concluding that George is mad and is wondering about the law of identity?

‚ÄúHeraclitus‚Äô regal possession is his extraordinary power to think intuitively. . . .Intuitive thinking embraces two things: one, the present many-colored and changing world that crowds in upon us in all our experiences, and two, the condition which alone make any experience of this world possible: time and space. For they may be perceived intuitively, even without a definite content, independent of all experience, purely in themselves. . . .And that past and future are as perishable as any dream, but that the present is but the dimensionless and durationless borderline between the two, and that space is just like time, and that everything which coexists in space and time has but a relative existence, that each thing exists through and for another like it, which is to say through and for an equally relative one.‚Äù (Pgs 52, 53)

67,"The Many Worlds Interpretation that was first put forth by Hugh Everett implies that there are infinite outcomes. It has seemingly become a leading interpretation among contemporary philosophers of physics and physicists alike. Does this doom existence to forever be populated with horror and terror beyond belief?

While not every physically possible outcome is implied, it is inevitable that somewhere in the wavefunction there will be outcomes that are horrible, no matter what we do. As these parallel universes are disconnected, there is nothing anyone, even in principle, can do about it.

A common dismissive reply to this tend to go along the lines of: ""Who cares? If the block universe is true, there is eternal suffering locked in the past, if inflation is true you also have infinite planets/worlds infinitely far away where similarly negative outcomes happen"" etc. While this is seemingly true, I personally feel that there is a unique existential doom and gloom implied by Everettian QM. If true, we can't even hope to eventually create a universe (at least our part of it) without suffering, even if we think 100 million years of progression into the future, since there will be branching all the time creating worldlines that are populated with infinite suffering.

92,"I don't purely see cancel culture as a form of vengeance like some others do. I see it on the same level as its relation to wealth. Cancel culture doesn't affect Trump. It doesn't affect Wall St. It doesn't affect anyone who's truly making this world go round. What it does and can affect though, is the artist. The person who doesn't just see numbers on a screen when it comes to the work they do. They put time, effort, and imagination into their craft because they know how important their work is to themselves. 

The reason I ask if cancel culture is another form of utilitarianism is because of its relation to money. Cancel culture exists because in most cases money = power. With money, that gives you the ability to do almost whatever you want without the worry of the law or social standards affecting you. And the one industry where there's a lot of money revolving around is the ""artistic industry."" Look inside that industry today and you'll see comedians, actors, painters, and writters, making millions of dollars off their crafts.

Now the reason I mention this is because cancel culture in itself doesn't seem to be a form of vengeance. Some individuals may see it that way but if you look at the bigger picture, money's relation to power, we can probably see the full picture of what cancel culture is really about. Billionaires make billions of dollars. And those ""CEO positions"" are seen as non-expendable. But artist positions are. And artists are making millions of dollars off their work so if you were the ""leader"" of cancel culture what would you feel like it's best to take away from an artist who did something immoral? Their art. And that's why I ask if cancel culture is a form of utilitarianism. 

If you look at the bigger picture of humanity, we only have one life to live. And most of us believe that everyone should live that life to its fullest. That's why a lot of people are anti the prison system. No one truly wants to hurt another person if it's not out of vengeance. What we want, is to protect others. Now when it comes to an artist, this person may be having the time of their life making the art they want to make. That's amazing. They found their purpose in life and I wouldn't want to take that away from them. But if it's their art that gave them the power to feel egotistical enough to be able to hurt someone and think they can get away with it; then that's why cancel culture must take away the art from the artist. That's part reason why I ask if cancel culture is a form of utilitarianism.

Cancel culture in itself to me feels like a necessary evil. We live in a world that wants humanity to make the most of the one life they live, but when power is involved we must take away what they love to get them to lose their power. We are hurting people, but it's for the betterment of mankind. And until we figure out a new system to where we can give people consequences for their actions by removing them away from the ability to commit immortal actions without taking their ability to create art away, ""cancel culture"" or formerly ""public anger"" will have to last until that sun will rise.",Is cancel culture a form of utilitarianism?,askphilosophy

98,"So I have recently got into egoism and it is really interesting, especially how it unexpectedly kinda creates a moral framework not that far outside the mainstream based on self interest.

Anyways, what interests me is edge cases, or where egoism differs from conventional morality.

For example, say there is a man drowning in a lake in a town we are visiting. It is unreasonable to expect that this man will ever have a real major impact on my life. And saving him involves the disutility of getting my clothes wet. So the ethical egoist wouldn't save them right? My first thought was the cooperation argument, but this man lives far away and won't affect out lives. I also considered a reputational argument, if you have a reputation for unconditionally aiding others, others are more likely to aid you. But again, we are in a far off town we won't return to, so reputation doesn't matter. Would the egoist simply let the man drown?

The second question is an objection to egoism I found on wikipedia:
&gt;Some perhaps decisive problems with ethical egoism have been pointed out.

One is that an ethical egoist would not want ethical egoism to be universalized: as it would be in the egoist's best self-interest if others acted altruistically towards them, they wouldn't want them to act egoistically; however, that is what they consider to be morally binding. Their moral principles would demand of others not to follow them, which can be considered self-defeating and leads to the question: ""How can ethical egoism be considered morally binding if its advocates do not want it to be universally applied?""

The third comes from a man who enjoys being abusive. Say there is a man and wife living in a remote area with not many people around to try and punish the man. The man is a psycho, who enjoys beating his wife. His wife hates it but feels too scared to flee. Would the egoist condemn this psycho wife beater? Again the cooperation argument and reputation argument fall apart here due to the lack of other people. The only real argument I can think of from an egoist pov is that by beating his wife, this man deprives himself of the joy of a loving relationship, the honest and loving companionship of his wife, and the feeling of happiness created by empathy upon seeing her happiness.

He then states that logic is not concerned with whether the premises of an inference are true or false, only in whether the conclusion follows from the premises.

To me, this makes no sense. If logic isn‚Äôt concerned with whether or not the premise is true, then it would at least be possible for the conclusion to follow in this example given that you have no additional context in which to understand the premise.

I didn't even really know that I was perceived as being ""black""  until middle school.    


In high school (A few months before Trump became president.)  there was a big class talk about confederate statues, whether or not we should tear them down or let them stay up. During this time I was going through my Steven crowder, right wing phase in life. Trump really motivated me to get engaged in politics. I was known as the debate bro in high school. I always wanted to be right and challenge peoples beliefs.  


  When it came to the confederates statues and flag I was divided at the time and am still divided. I use to believe that the statues were a part of some ""heritage"" of southern pride. I wanted to give people the benefit of the doubt. I never wanted to believe people were just racist.

Now that I have walked away from the alt right. I have changed my view on statues, but I still hold the same answer. Personally I don't believe in fighting symbols (statues.)   I believe in fighting ideas (the ideologies that form hatred). The way I look at it is that we can take any symbol and assign whatever idea we want on it. We could take a peace symbol and form an authoritarian right government with that symbol and commit   terrible actions. But the problem is not the symbol.

For example, if the big crunch theory of the universe is true and there really is an endless cycle of rebirth for the universe, then presumably someday in the extremely far future a collection of atoms will form into the exact same configuration as they are in within my body right now, down to the quantum state of each particle. Obviously this would be extremely unlikely but given an infinite amount of time it would happen.

My question is - would this really be *me*? As in, would the same consciousness that exists within me currently have a subjective experience as that collection of atoms? 

I have trouble with this question because on one hand, I think that if you made an exact clone of me within this universe, I wouldn‚Äôt have a conscious experience as the clone. Likewise if an exact copy of me were to form through evolution somewhere else within this universe, surely I wouldn‚Äôt experience what that being experiences from x billion light years away. But on the other hand, I‚Äôm not a dualist. I think everything that consciousness is can be found within the body in physical form. If both of these things are true it seems to me like there must be no such thing as a subjective experience.

This rests on the Principle of Indifference, that we are no more different from those simulations- in particular the human minds.

However there's a counter argument which states that we shouldn't be counting the number of simulations that we created as evidence that we are in a simulation.  We know we created them, and hence the principle of indifference does not apply. We have no information about whether we are in a simulation, and using the number of simulations that we created to calculate the odds of us also being in one is misleading. For instance, are we really more likely to be in a simulation if we increased the number of similations from 10^9 to say 10^30? It seems arbitrary.


I think there is something to be made of the event where some of the simulations also go on to make similations and some of those simulations do the same too, etc, that would grant there being a strong chance of us being in a simulation too, but I don't have a rigorous argument for it. However, for only one level down, where only we create ancestor simulations but those simulations don't, the above counter argument has me more swayed.

138,"The background to my question is an intriguing ancestral investigation:

My family history includes some lists of male lineages, which were recorded inside the covers of ‚Äúfamily Bibles‚Äù, extending in one case to a 9th Great Grandfather called Robert Cant from Queensferry in Scotland (who married in 1643). My 8th and 7th Great Grandfathers were both called John Cant; then my 6th to 2nd to Great Grandfathers were all called George Cant.  The George Cant who was my 2nd Great Grandfather was a master boilermaker and worked on constructing the original Forth Rail Bridge in 19th century.

My Great Aunt, who died about 20 years ago, had often said that she was related to the philosopher Immanuel Kant; however, there was no documentary evidence. There was also a rumour that an ancestor had been executed after being accused of witchcraft.

Researching these things recently, I found that the [Scottish witchcraft database](http://witches.shca.ed.ac.uk/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.searchaccused) includes two women from Queensferry with the same surname who were accused of witchcraft at a time contemporaneous with my 9th Great Grandfather: Elspeth Cant (1643) 
and Janet Cant (1649).

It was also interesting to discover that Immanuel Kant‚Äôs father was called ‚ÄúJohann Georg Kant‚Äù (i.e. John George Cant) and his grandfather was called Hans Kant (i.e. Johannes/John Cant) and that Immanuel Kant himself had stated that this grandfather was a Scottish emigrant.  Immanuel Kant‚Äôs grandfather (Hans Kant/John Cant) lived at the same time as my 9th Great Grandfather, John Cant.

It may forever remain unknown whether my 17th century ancestors were accused of witchcraft and/or related to Immanuel Kant‚Ä¶ but what if both of those possibilities were true? Could Immanuel Kant‚Äôs grandfather have emigrated from Scotland due to accusations of witchcraft in his family? Does it support an idea that intelligent females were accused of witchcraft at that time, whereas equivalent males were called ‚Äògreat philosophers‚Äô?  Could the unknowable noumenon of Immanuel Kant‚Äôs philosophy have connections with the mysticism of 17th century witchcraft?

Like, Humans are more conscious than, say, Venus Flytraps, because our faculties for receiving and interpreting sense data, having thoughts and attitudes, etc are more complicated and multifaceted.

However, this sort of ""complexity"" is rarely defined. Like, a brass alloy is materially more complex than a lump of pure copper - does that mean brass is more conscious than copper? I don't think so, and I don't think most panpsychists would say so either. And it probably isn't purely based on the ability to receive and interpret data, since by that logic basically every modern computer is more conscious than a human by several orders of magnitude.

My question: How can the chicken have come first if chickens came from a former species?

The reason for my confusion (given we agree evolution or adaptation helped to design the first chicken):

For a chicken to be defined as a chicken, it must meet a certain number of criteria about the characteristics of the species. (What those are is irrelevant.) At some point, a species that adapted into chickens was not chickens. Because adaptation and evolution are generational changes caused by mutations and selective breeding, and not changes that take place durning the animal‚Äôs life, the members of the former species could not have transformed into a chicken during their lives. This means at some point an animal was born with enough characteristics to be classified as a chicken. This would be the first chicken, and while in its egg, the first chicken egg. 

I understand this seems too simple. I agree. So please, help me understand how the chicken could have come before the egg. Any examples of this discussion already in existence would be appreciated.

234,"This is something I've recently been thinking about quite a lot.
I used to love weed and being high and it would make me comfortable doing most stuff even being bored was fine, I'd claim I'd enjoy doing nothing but then i got to reflect on it and I really didn't I enjoy doing lots of things but being bored is fine not fun.
So basically I think we should try to justify our likes and preferences to ourselves like why we enjoy something, why is it great for you, not to OTHERS but to YOURSELF emphasis on this.

The reason im here is because I'd some advice or opinion on this mindset. Also my I wanna help my mom... She's been very lonely lately and not in the mood to do anything, she's developed habits that allow her to just work and come home and watch TV, on weekends she often sleeps all day or watches more TV, I feel like I should push for a change as she often complains the TV is boring and that sleeping away her free time is a waste of life and feels sad about it but when I confront her she basically claims she doesn't like doing stuff or doesn't want to and what makes me most upset, that she can't do it. Whenever i ask what she dislikes about certain activities she just claims she dislikes them because yes (idk why but most parents I know behave like this) and she pretty much doesn't cook anymore and tries to order everything, only cleans when needed, I dont mind doing those tasks myself but Im worried that she's just too comfortable being bored.

I believe we should try to reason with ourselves to why something is good or bad, even if the reason is just ""It feels good"" doesn't need to be too deep but honest.
I also believe my mom is doing a routine that will lead to depression and feelings of unaccomplishment.

(Reason for this post) Im really worried because my grandfather passed away and today's his birthday, and my mom promised she'd honor his memory by doing what he always did on this day, he'd go out a buy a new book because he loved reading and there's this ""book event"" in my town, and today I asked if my mom was going like she did in the previous years but she said she wouldn't because nobody wanted to go with her, which to my ideology is not great to begin with as we should feel good in our own skin and by ourselves in the first place I just feel bad telling her what's right or wrong as its not my life.

15,"I'm not well educated on the discussions about property rights and capitalism in the fields of Ethics and Economic Theory, so I'm going to just write a discussion I recently had with a friend about these topics so you can evaluate who's right. English isn't my first language, so you should ask for clarification if you don't understand something. 

My friend's reasoning was the following: due to the *subjective labor theory of value*, people are going to pay more for goods and services they find more useful and better for their lives, independently of what they are or who provide/produce them. That is to say some people will earn more than others  because some products of labor (and the labor itself invested in those products) are perceived to be more valuable than others and, consequently, more expensive. 

While he accepted it's true the fact that a capitalist can't earn billions of dollars simply by working the same amount of time and earning the same salary their average workers do, the same isn't the case for the work of the capitalist himself, since his work is the most important for the success of a business. He goes on saying a capitalist have a job that consumes all of his time and faces a huge risk of bankruptcy that can ruin his life, while his workers will just lose their jobs and can find new ones if something goes wrong in the company. 

If the subjective value of the work of people working for a big company is already high, the capitalist should have even higher earnings because those people can only survive due to the hard and smart work of the capitalist. The capitalist has to meet important people all the time and convince them to invest in his company and also make politicians help him by making the market even more competitive to drive more innovation and better goods and services for customers. This would make the labor of the workers of that company even more valuable and so would the capitalist labor too, making everybody earn more and customers have access to better things.

He concluded his reasoning by saying poverty exists because politicians are inefficient to fight it and try to corrupt the system all the time by stealing poor people money to implement bad policies (and taking some of that money for themselves). If those politicians were to follow the laws of the free market then poverty wouldn't exist because everybody would have good jobs in a competitive economy. In this economy we would have even more capitalists doing the most important jobs and earning even more money, so taking that money from them would be illegitimate because is the value of their work, so it would be theft. 

I've replied to most of his comments by saying that politicians and the State are more likely to help the capitalist protect his property during economic crises rather than otherwise. Those same capitalists, in many countries, actually fight for the government to implement protectionist policies to protect their businesses of external competition, so they don't have to worry about more investment, innovation or providing better goods and services to their clients. In these cases, a significant portion of the profits go to the pockets of the capitalists rather than back to improve their businesses. They can therefore expend more money with luxuries while their employees will continue earning the same (or less). There are even cases of powerful countries destroying foreign industries to promote their own, like Great Britain did many times no long ago. 

If the subjective value of the work of the capitalist is so high due to their smartness or importance, so the labor of high-ranking politicians should also be. The world leaders convince rich and important people to invest in their countries and they also have jobs that take all of their times. The risk is also very high, since politicians face an even greater risk of getting killed by adversaries or going bankrupted due to lawsuits filled against them. If that's the case, they also should earn billions of dollars -- but they don't, since government salaries are actually much lower than the profits of a big company. Even the corporate money politicians have access outside of their earnings from the government is much lower than what capitalists have out of their profits. Sometimes the capitalist and politician are the same person. 

I finished my reasoning saying that a capitalist earns a lot of money not due to their smartness or importance, but to the amount of power he has. An individual with a lot of power can take things away from people without facing much resistance from them, just like a slave owner can give miserably lives to his slaves and profit from their labor. Bad policy isn't just a product of stupidity of politicians, but also of lobbying from corporations who want the implementation of policies that will fuel them with more money and influence. This can create inequality and, therefore, poverty, not withstanding the fact that a significant portion of capitalists were people already born into wealthy families rather than common people building everything out of nothing. That is, they didn't create power since it was already there waiting for them.

22,"  Okay, so there's a lot of discussion and suggestions from thousands of  people about how to live one's life. But are the suggestions actually  things that make one happy, that fulfill one's soul's innermost desires?  My question is, what should I do right now and here, something I've  been thinking about for a while and that I find very paradoxical at  times. 

**The Paradox**

Many  suggestions for what to do with one's life assume that one already has  some control over their life. You have the desire to do what is being  said/suggested, and you are motivated enough and have the control in  your life to do it. It could be all kinds of exercises or anything   (Like meditate every day, eat healthy etc). I see a huge problem with  this, as it can cause a lot of misery. The control that is needed is  non-existent in 90% of people. They do not have the willpower and  control to do what is being asked. You feels guilty when you don't do  it, which over time and in the long run can be destructive to one's  self-esteem.

Let me say here: You have no control!

What  should one do then?? It's a paradoxical statement, as our reaction to  the statement is out of our control. Most people use this sentence as a  comfort and as a reason not to try. The sentence in the deterministic  life can make one give up on any control and surrender to the bad life.   I think one ends up in a paradoxical dilemma: Guilt (Misery) or  Acceptance (Misery)

**Bad Solution i tried to find**

Maybe  one can find a middle way I think. Would it be useful to pretend that  the illusion of control/free will exists and at the same time accept  that you have no control in your life. Accept everything that happens in  your life and enjoy the peace that is now present. No need to do  anything or have any goals because things are accepted as they are now.  At the same time with this inner peace you still give over to the  illusion of control on an intellectual level, but don't get disappointed  if it doesn't work.

This is the  best solution I can find, but this solution requires that one is hit by  some sort of external light. If you don't have control right now, you  can't choose my solution to accept everything that happens and you will  feel guilty for not accepting it and for feeling guilty. My solution is  now just one of thousands of solutions that fall under the paradox.

27,"You are a researcher who has created a perfect simulation of the Earth that is populated by beings functionally identical to humans. They have genuine feelings, beliefs, and aspirations. You have total control over this simulation, i.e., you determine if this universe continues to exist, as well as what could happen in this universe, and you know everything that happens in this universe. 

Thoughts on whether or not you should inform the beings that they are simulated. Below are my thoughts, give comments or counter-arguments:  
Not telling the beings to guarantee more rights:

The premise of this argument is that:

What do we value in this round: People‚Äôs feelings of having freedom and agency exceed true freedom and agency:

1. Philosophers generally divide the concept of free will into two sub-categories, first &amp; second-order free will. First-order free will is complete freedom from outside influences, which is generally considered impossible to attain, and second-order free will is the ability to make decisions within the relatively loose constraints of normal social &amp; physical influences.
   1. The thing is, second-order free will is experiential. Because first order free-will is restricted sub-consciously, the experiential *feeling* of first-order free will is a closer approximation of the human right to self-determination. The loss of that feeling is the same as the loss of their freedom.
2. The experience of agency adds meaning to life‚Äìit keeps our actions connected to our consciousness &amp; allows us to experience all manner of things from pride to sorrow to joy-but how could you take pride in your accomplishments knowing you were simply running a predetermined code? How poisonous and manipulative would love feel when you knew you didn‚Äôt feel that way by choice? 
3. The non-existence of a feeling of free will prohibits the depth of happiness because humans are resilient in nature. If we have a thought experiment of a slavery, there are two assumptions of this slave: First, he loves farming crops. Second, he feels unfree subjected to the absolute command of his master. Now, let‚Äôs assume his master coerces him to farm, would he enjoy it to the same extent in a world he felt free to farm by his heart? No, he would feel toxically forced to do so. On a second layer slavery often finds the most fulfillment in rebelling against their masters which a truism of determinism provides no outlets to even rebellion on the other side. 
4. A note on preemption: Had we asked a random stranger of which freedom he prefers, maybe he would choose the abstract one. But importantly, whenever you introduce this trade-off for people to make, you are essentially introducing a trade-off that a person would lose out on smth regardless of the choice. So people cannot fairly assess what freedom they want because knowing the fact that they can suffer a great loss is itself an anxiety. \*\*Not included in debate but a weighing if the other side says it.  

I wanna talk about mutual exclusivity: Prop can‚Äôt just tell you the current world is fatalistic too. First, there is no direct comparative of an exact same species that told us that we are technologically created. Most of us think that we are naturally brought to the world and have some destined purposes or self-determination. Second, there‚Äôs not that one person who tells everyone that they are barely robots created. In their world, the scientist is telling the populations. Third, not all people believe in determinism because it cannot be proven definitively, but Proposition makes the answer to hard determinism definitive. 

Lastly on weighing mechanisms: We think that neither world can guarantee perfect rights for everyone, and we must maximize the rights protected. Note that the right to truth is very very fishy because first, like we can‚Äôt access truth to all the things undiscovered yet, so even if you grant people one piece of truth, there are still a billion others that are unattainable. But even if this piece of truth is uniquely important, we don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true anyway. Perfect epistemology is impossible unless you know all the relevant facts about the universe. We might be the ones in a stimulation, and the people in the stimulation are not, so you can‚Äôt label anything to be true unless you know every factor that can alter the truth. But we know for sure from my analysis that by telling the ‚Äútruth‚Äù, there will be massive harm incurred.",Simulation,askphilosophy
28,"**I need help** understanding how the argument for the truth of truth-relativism is valid.

I have attempted to explain how the argument for relativism is valid, and I think I am on the right track, but I need help completing my proposed solution and understanding it more fully.

**Question 1:** Is the Argument for the Truth of Relativism Deductively Valid in Form?

**Argument R** (for the truth of relativism):

* **P1.** Positive Thesis = A claim is only evaluable with respect to a  
point of view
* **P2.** Negative Thesis = There are no absolute truths
* **P3.** Relativism = Positive Thesis &amp; Negative Thesis
* **P4.** Relativism is true if and only if both its positive and negative theses are true
* **C**onclusion. Relativism is true.

***Is the argument for the truth of relativism valid?***

* If so, how so?
* Explain! If not, why not?

**What I have figured out thus far...**

Relativism is self defeating: because its constituent elements: its positive and negative theses are in direct conflict with one another, which yield a contradiction, which is a necessary falsity. Therefore, relativism is contradictory on its own terms and is not logically sound though it is logically valid.

A deductively valid argument is such for which true premises would necessarily lead to a true conclusion; that is, for which it is impossible for the premises to (all) be true, yet the conclusion false.So, we can devise a validity test: assume the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false and observe whether a contradiction arises. If a contradiction does arise, then the argument is valid, because a valid argument is one in which it is impossible for the premises to be true while the conclusion false.

**Relativism:= Positive thesis + Negative thesis**

If we grant both the premises true, then relativism is true. Relativism is true if and only if both the negative and positive these are true. However, granting them both true yields a contradiction, which is a necessary falsity that cannot possibly be true. To make the conclusion false is to say that relativism is false.

The argument for the truth of truth-relativism consists of two premises: the negative and positive theses, where **the negative thesis contradicts itself and where the negative and positive theses contradict one another.** For a valid deductive argument, if the premises could all be true, then the conclusion must also be true. However, premises P1 (positive thesis) and P2 (negative thesis) cannot both be true, they yield a contradiction. Therefore we conclude that the conjunction of P1 and P2 is not true: \[P1 \^ P2\] = F (*where*: F for '*false*').

**A contradiction arises** out of jointly affirming the positive and negative theses (taking them both to be true). If there are no absolute truths, then it cannot be stated that claims are only evaluable with respect to point of view. And if claims are only to be evaluated with respect to a point of view, then in whose point of view does one claim that ""there are no absolute truths‚Äù. By leaving out the point of view, a claim becomes unevaluable (since the qualifier in whose case a claim may be evaluable is not supplied).

**No contradiction arises** from granting the premises true and making the conclusion false.

**A contradiction arises: namely, that one both arises (as a result of granting the premises true) and does not arise (as a result of setting the conclusion to be false).** This latter contradiction resulting from applying the validity test, namely that a contradiction both arises and does not arise, is the indicator that **this argument is valid.**

**Question 2:** How can you complete my proof that the argument for the truth of relativism is valid but not sound?

**Question 3:** Is my proposed solution sufficient to explain why the argument for relativism is valid?

I need help understanding my proposed solution better. Please comment on what I have got right and what wrong in my proposed solution.

My understanding is that in general the contemporary physicalist idea would be to simply define perception as the physical correlates of perception thus defining away the problem.  There are a couple of obvious issues that I see with this.

1. That definition simply isn't compatible with the standard common sense definition of perception
2. The definition is circular

Now of course noone would spell out their definition of perception as ""the physical correlates of perception"" but I often encounter people saying that perception is ""neural activity"" or something else along those lines.  The trouble of course is that ""neural activity"" is obviously too broad as there are some types of neural activity that clearly aren't perception.  The implication is that they are talking about a specific subset of neural activity.  Which subset? I can only assume they mean the subset corresponding to perception.

Now these critiques may be based on a woefully misinformed understanding of physicalist accounts of perception, which is part of why I'm asking the question.  I only mention them because these are the things that I'd like to get cleared up.",Physicalist Accounts of Perception,askphilosophy

50,"The discussion:

From what I've seen so far, philosophers have categorised evil into man-made evil and natural evil, but what about evil that God himself has carried out?

Take for example Noah's flood, now as far as I can tell there's no scientific evidence that a world wide flood actually occurred, and there's a good chance that the amount of water required to raise the sea level by multiple kilometres was impossible to generate via non-supernatural means. I understand there's a few other inconsistencies with this story but that's not really the topic of this question. 

I'm not sure if theologians accept this story as true or if it is more of a proverb or cautionary tale, but to my understanding it is a cornerstone of the bible and generally accepted by Christians as an example of the kinds of things that God has done and a testament to his power. With that in mind, if we are to take it as an example of an act that God has done, or would have done, I think we might be able to consider it as an evil act. 

Now I understand that there's probably disagreement on the definition of the word evil, and God's morality versus human's morality, but I think a case could be made that killing almost the entire population of the world (humans and animals) is an act of evil. Drowning is not a painless or peaceful death, and it's not difficult to imagine that many people would have died in other more painful ways during the resulting commotion. 

In the case of the flood, from memory, God killed all the people and animals because humans had become corrupted. But it seems highly improbable that absolutely everyone including small children had become evil. Not to mention all the animals that were caught up in the mix that could be considered innocent bystanders.

From what I can tell so far, the best argument that God would allow humans to commit evil is to allow us to have free will. One of the best arguments for natural evil is that God can't prevent evil that is logically impossible to prevent. But what is the argument that supports an omnibenevolent God doing evil acts himself?

Even if the flood didn't occur, the flood story forms an integral description of the nature of God. If the nature of God is to destroy all the humans and animals, can he be considered omnibenevolent?

51,"I recently read Gogias, and followed the earlier arguments fairly well. But Socrates loses me when he insists that when we do wrong (commit injustices of various sorts), the best thing for us is to be judged and punished. Not for society, but for us as individuals. 

He suggests that this is like a sick person who is made better by unpleasant medical treatment. We may not like the treatment, but it's better than being sick. 

When we commit injustice, the actual harm is done to us (to our souls), according to Socrates. Since we can't be harmed by the injustice of others (at the soul level, which really matters), any damage we've done to society or others is secondary to the greater harm we've done to ourselves. 

Makes sense so far. 

But how does it follow that being judged and punished is the best thing for us, akin to unpleasant medical treatment? 

Since the damage is already done (to your soul), I'd imagine that recognizing that you'd done injustice, and deciding to do better in the future would be the best option. How does third-party judgement and punishment help you?

If you failed to realize that you'd done wrong or refused to change your intentions for the future, then judgement and punishment by a third party is unlikely to change that. Your soul is still damaged and you're still as ignorant of your failings as ever. 

Or is Socrates suggesting that punishment is akin to wearing a hair shirt or mortification of the flesh in the Christian tradition ‚Äî a means penance/cleansing sins? This strikes me as unlikely ‚Äî I've never heard Socrates say anything of the sort.

Obviously, humans have a complicated society, which is filled with relationships, economics, recreation, transportation, jobs, experiences, etcetera. But although that provides fulfillment, aren't we just here to have pass on our genes and that's all that matters? Don't get me wrong, I understand that life has so many nuances, varying factors, and emotions, which people definitely derive what they see as meaning from, but in the end isn't the only thing that matters in terms of species just reproductive success? 

I know there were bad people throughout history who did terrible things, yet had children. No matter how godawful they may be, and no matter what terrible things they've done,  in the grand scheme of things   haven't they achieved the objective of life, passing on genes?

65,"  I‚Äôve been struggling with some concerning thoughts surrounding ethics lately. Now, I haven‚Äôt read a huge amount of philosophy, but I have read some David Hume and I suppose my ideas are an extension of that. I‚Äôm actually hoping someone can correct these ideas I‚Äôm having, because as I said, they lead to some worrying conclusions for me.

Now, for Hume it seems as if our ethics are reliant upon our intrinsic passions, desires, emotions etc. This seems reasonable to me, in the sense that reason and facts alone are not enough to motivate an individual to act or evaluate action. 

If we imagine a computer that has every fact of existence programmed into it, it would seem as if this computer would still not have any motivation to act, or to evaluate these facts of existence. That is to say, it would not morally differentiate between the fact that ‚ÄòHolland is a country‚Äô or that ‚Äò6 million Jewish people died in the holocaust,‚Äô or that ‚Äòglobal warming could pose a serious threat to the future of humanity.‚Äô None of these facts would be good or bad, because the computer has no inherent desires, emotions, motivations etc.

But if we program into it some motivation or goal, to take a famous example, 'making as many paperclips as possible,‚Äô then suddenly it is able to evaluate these facts in accordance with this specific motivation. It starts figuring out how paperclips are made and changing the world in accordance with this goal. And eventually, if the computer is powerful enough and has enough resources at its disposal, then it will seek to create a world where everything is made of paperclips, and humans are turned into paperclips and it starts, you know, going off into space and turning planets into paperclips and so on. Hopefully this story is familiar to you, I forget who its by. 

So, often this story is interpreted as a warning against the dangers of artificial intelligence. But what I‚Äôm wondering is, are humans essentially paper clips machines? That is to say, do we just go about transforming reality in accordance with some biologically predetermined motivation? 

To us, the world created by the paperclip machine is repulsive, but that is because we are evaluating it in accordance with our inherent desires, just as the paperclip machine looks out at the world populated by humans and can imagine a ‚Äòbetter‚Äô world in which the humans are converted into paperclips. 

This line of thought leads me down a road of, if not complete moral relativism, then at least a sort of biologically determined relativism. Humans have certain commonalities in what we intrinsically want. We can imagine a utopia in which the world is beautiful and there is little human suffering and there are lots of wonderful cities and parks and nature with lots of fun things to do‚Äîbut the ‚Äògoodness‚Äô of this can only be evaluated under our own anthropocentric criteria.

Libertarian free will says that your choices are not determined, so in my understanding this means that both choices A and Not A have a non-zero chance, given a prior state X.

I'm having trouble separating this from random chance. Isn't that what random chance is: when the result is undetermined from the prior states?

Even if you have a 99% chance of choosing A and a 1% chance of choosing Not A, there's still an element of randomness that allows for either option to happen.

This is uncomfortable to me, because when I think about my own freewill, I think about my desires, personality, vices, virtues, etc. that come together to inform my choices. It doesn't seem like random chance has any place in there.

74,"I have recently started studying Hegel in order to be a better Marxist.

I am used to what I understand to be the 'analytical' mode of philosophy, which mirrors mathematics in that it is logical and axiomatic - beginning with definitions and reasoning about them to draw conclusions.

Hegel is the opposite. To me, understanding Hegel has been analogous to learning a language for the first time - what you absolutely cannot do when learning a language for the first time is read a dictionary. You don't yet know what words mean! Instead, you must study/absorb words in their contexts, relations, associations, and so on. Once this is complete, you must synthesize all this information together and \*only then\* do definitions manifest. In the analytic tradition, definitions come first. In dialectics, they come last.

There is an application of this way of thinking, if I understand it correctly.

In neoclassical economics, 'capital' is defined as wealth that lasts more than a year. For Piketty in his 'Capital in the 21st Century', it is defined as stuff you own that generates an income, like rent or stocks. For Marx, it is something more nuanced (not intimately familiar with it).

There is a temptation here to fall into definitional relativism and say ""it depends on what you mean by 'capital'."" This is problematic though, because we then have to say the same thing about concepts like 'freedom' and 'justice'. The way to understand ideas like 'capital', 'freedom', and 'justice' is to apply the dialectical method to these concepts (the way Hegel does with things like sense-certainty), interrogate them, and come out with an understanding of them at the end.

Is my reasoning a correct understanding of dialectics? Furthermore, is my language analogy consistent with known philosophy of language (I haven't read much on that)?

78,"This idea has been with me for about a year or so now; it does not lend itself to uneducated/uninformed search attempts. I understand it is definitely not even just a dead end, but a waste of time. I still plan on writing an undergraduate thesis on the subject and seeing what truth does exist in the idea. The closest I‚Äôve come to finding a book that gives me good ideas about the project is probably Haugeland - Artificial Intelligence, so maybe stuff like that is where I should start. But maybe even getting more abstract is necessary. I also think Godel code might be relevant, but it‚Äôs a bit too complicated for me. I imagine Claude Shannon‚Äôs work could be a concrete departure as well.  

I got the idea by posting on a message board. If you go there you will probably figure out who I am pretty quickly. The idea starts with every post on a message board being numbered. That is pretty standard, but Reddit doesn‚Äôt work for this. Anyway, since you have a bunch of numbers, you can assign a quality to the numbers. I went with presidents. Imagine a thread with 46 posts. Those are all the presidents. A 47th post is the next incumbent, and as such any post that goes beyond the current incumbent is a projection into the future. I guess the connection between the number and the quality is a pretty important thing, but idk what it means. It‚Äôs kind of just an axiom for me. I understand nothing really can be said to bind the quality‚Äôs properties to the number. 

Effectively, what this does, is simulate the USA with every iteration in each thread. The longer it goes on, the further into the future you can project your statements. I also sub in other countries occasionally. The idea is that you pick a topic for your thread and watch it progress through each presidency. Really sorry if you end up in South Sudan, lol. 

The first thing I noticed is that you can do ‚Äòfun math‚Äô with this. Obviously by fun math I mean fake math. But, consider for a minute that John Quincy Adams is the son of a president, and Justin Trudeau is the son of a PM (PM = president in this scheme, just to make things simpler). So, since JQA is the 6th president, and JT is the first PM to resemble JQA in a specific way, the true Canadian incumbent is actually the 6th president of Canada. So, there are token ‚Äòmoves‚Äô in the list that can show up in different places for other countries. 

6th president of Canada, now why would you need to make a claim like that? Well, the second step of the idea is that some things that happened when JQA was president, are happening now, in Canada. It‚Äôs limited to analogy, as far as I can see. So the idea here is that events can have an analog that ‚Äòtranslate‚Äô to an event that is going on now. Almost all of this depends on a single property being repeated and having similar effects. So the 23rd PM is the ‚Äòactual‚Äô executive, but the ‚Äò6th president‚Äô PM is a constructed state of affairs that makes an analogy between JQA and JT‚Äôs tenures. This ‚Äòtime travel‚Äô also applies to presidents within their county, so if Trump wins another election it‚Äôs back to the Grover Cleveland days. 

Sometimes I also interpret posts based on who the president is, like if the president fought a war, then the poster who represents the pres is engaged in a state of conflict. So there is a sense that the assigned quality, in a preexisting list of qualities, could be used to interpret messages in this way. I guess this might deal with semantics or something. 

I know it sounds silly but I am trying to develop a ‚Äòradar‚Äô whereby you can locate specific things based on who a president (or some other quality), what country the thread currently exists as, etc, or something. Hard to explain this part so I‚Äôm just going to leave it at ‚ÄúI want to build a semantic radar‚Äù.

I define imagery as imagery corresponding to each sense:   


Imagery is a sensory-like representation occurring in the absence of sensory input.

Auditory imagery (hearing sounds)  
Visual imagery (seeing images in dreams or while remembering something)  
Olfactory imagery (getting a sense of smell in its absence)  
Kinesthetic imagery (feeling movement while listening to music)  
Verbal imagery (inner voice)

If we can fully explain how this imagery occurs, wouldn't we explain the most important part of consciousness - awareness of subjective experience?  


The complexity of this subjective experience may then depend on how these imageries interact with each other and modify the final perception. Even ambiguity or noisy imagery might make things subjective.

116,"I am reading Hicks's books on Nietzsche and the Nazis, and he makes a point that Nietzsche was a collectivist. I looked up some of the threads on here but none of them really addressed some of the quotations he used to back up his case. Hence I will present them here, give my own interpretation, and ask for your thoughts.

There is a quotation in the Genealogy of Morals where Nietzsche says: ‚Äúmankind in the mass sacrificed to the
prosperity of a single stronger species of man‚Äîthat would be an
advance‚Äù. Other respondents on this subreddit merely dismissed the claim that Nietzche thought of the Overman as a betterment of the whole species without explaining why, but I will present an argument. 

There are two possibilities. Either when Nietzsche talks about the betterment of the species he does not have the Overman in mind, which seems gratuitous. The other possibility is that he does have the Overman in mind, but he does not mean the betterment and transformation of the entire species of the human race. We can lend support to this interpretation by way of two quotations, one of them the quotation already above. The other is in Thus Spoke Zarathustra where Zarathustra declaims he will not speak to the public but only to certain individuals. On this reading, only select individuals from the human race will transform into the new species of the Overman. This interpretation does not lend much credence to collectivism.

There is another point to be made. Hicks says that since Nietzsche thinks sacrificing many others is morally desirable as a means to an end, he is thus a collectivist. The quotations are pretty unambiguous concerning Nietzsche's ruthlessness, but I do not think this necessarily entails collectivism. A psychopath is willing to sacrifice others but that does not make him a collectivist.

These are the thoughts I had when dissecting Hicks's claim, and I am curious enough to inquire as to whether my analysis here coheres with the opinions of the Nietzsche experts on this subreddit.",Stephen Hicks and Nietzsche,askphilosophy

}. However, the frequentist approach depends on the law of large numbers. At a small number of frequencies, the result is unreliable. In that case the subjective Bayesian probabilities  could be more accurate. So, how do I pick which probabilities to use when assessing a bet? I know the two probabilities have different interpretations. We are talking apples and oranges. But when do I choose apples over oranges, if I may? 

**Suppose** We  have flipped an unfair coin 3 times and got {Tail, Tail, Head}. Furthermore, suppose the coin is such that Tail comes with 40% chance. Finally I am told and believe that the coin is unfair with 20% probability for Head. (False knowledge). 

&amp;#x200B;

**At time =1:** 

Frequentist method (F) will suggest  that the probability of Tail is 2/3. 

Bayesian (B) would employ a prior probability distribution that assigns 20% chance of Tail. I wont go into the math, but i think it is reasonable to assume that it will be drastically different from 2/3. Also it is less correct. (neither of them is correct)

\-so one should evaluate the bet using F probability 

&amp;#x200B;

**At time = 2:**  


We flip the coin  3 more times and get H, T, H. So now we have {T, T, H, H, T, H}. Also we find out that the previous belief about the distribution was false. Hence we assign uniform  distribution to the prior.

&amp;#x200B;

F will assign 3/5 or 50% to Tail. B will assign 4/8 or 50%/ (using Laplase's Rule of Succession  P(x) = (X+1)/ (N+2) )  

So the two methods produce equal probabilities. Both incorrect.

&amp;#x200B;

**At time 3:** 

We flip the coin  2 more times and get H, T. So now we have {T, T, H, H, T, H, H, T}. Also we find out  the true prior distribution.   Hence we assign 40% to Tail.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'd expect B method to generate more accurate posterior probability for Tails than F, which still produces 50%.  

&amp;#x200B;

134,"I recently saw a YouTube video about Matt Walsh's documentary film ""What is a Woman?"". In the movie Walsh goes around asking people ""what is a woman?"" often with the effect of making the person he is asking look foolish because they don't have a quick easy answer. To me, it feels like there is a fallacy in asking this question, but I don't know if there is a formal definition of one.

The closest thing I can think of would be something like ""Asking a Tautological question"", where the questioner frames a question in a way that implies there is a simple easy answer, but for which the only answers that are simple are inherently Tautological. For instance, the [Merriam Webster definition of woman](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/female) is ""an adult female person"", which is either a full blown tautology or requires the reader to refer to the definition of female, which is much more complex.

This means the person being asked the question can either:

1. Respond with a tautology (e.g., ""a woman is a woman"", or ""an adult female human""), which makes them look foolish
2. Provide a complicated answer, which again makes them look foolish because the framing of the question implies there is a simple easy answer
3. Refuse to answer the question, which makes them look like like they can't answer a simple question
4. Challenge the framing of the question, which again makes them look like they can't answer a simple question

Because the framing embeds the idea that there should be a simple answer, I suppose this could be a loaded question. But I usually think of the assumptions that are embedded in loaded questions to be more closely related to the subject or argument being debated (but then again, the idea that ""gender is simple"" is one of the arguments Matt Walsh is trying to put forth). Also I suppose the best response to this is to challenge the framing (which is the best way to respond to a loaded question), but it seems particularly difficult to do so here. I think the best response would be ""That's an interesting question. What do you think?"" which does challenge the idea that there should be a simple answer, but doesn't directly refute it (at least not strongly) and also puts the onus on the question to illustrate that it is simple. The questioner can still claim you are dodging the question but at least you can now do the same.

141,"So I posted this question in r/NoStupidQuestions and didn't get many satisfying answers to be honest. I'm thinking that probably wasn't really the correct sub for this type of question. I looked into my question a bit more, and it seems that what I'm thinking of may be a sort of form of panpsychism? Again, I will preface this by saying this isn't necessarily a belief that I personally hold, but I'm seeming to find it difficult to refute (perhaps though that is just the nature of any theory of consciousness). 

 I'm currently reading Yuval Harari's 'Homo Deus' and it's discussing a bit about the comparison between the human consciousness and a computer.  From my \*very rudimentary\* understanding, the human brain works through the automatic firing of neurons and we believe this somehow creates our subjective experiences but we don't know how or why that would be. 

He makes the comparison between how our brains work to that of a neural network, and goes on to question why humans have some form of awareness and the ai does not. This led me to question why we operate on the assumption that this is the case? With such a limited understanding of how our own consciousness originates how can we say for certain that it doesn't exist outside the animal kingdom?

 To draw in an earlier comparison, he was writing about how in the 17th century it was a commonly held belief that animals were 'automata' - their reactions were caused only by automatic processes within their brain but no subjective experience exists. Scientific evidence heavily points to this being false. Couldn't the idea that ai is not conscious also stem from an incomplete understanding of the concept?

 To define, I'm thinking of consciousness as the most basic definition of having a unique subjective experience or possibly even extending to a basic awareness of one's own self. 

It doesn't seem completely crazy to me to think that some rudimentary form of consciousness exists within all forms of matter to varying levels of complexity. Or perhaps, consciousness is something that originates from more complex connections and systems (i.e. a neural network or our own brains).

I do think that the way we determine or quantify what makes something conscious is fundamentally flawed. We seem to ask the question ""does it act like us?"" when I don't think this is really the right question. We need to ask ""does it experience?"" and this is something we can never know. A complex ai seemingly could have some rudimentary form of experience, but it may not feel things such as desire or it's experience of the world is so far removed from ours that it doesn't act in a way we would expect a 'conscious being' to act.

What are your thoughts? Is there something that can refute this point of thinking? Or are any theories about our consciousness essentially irrefutable? 

For example, I can't even know if anyone else in the world is conscious I just make the assumption based off observing them and seeing they are similar to me (this is really the case for both humans and animals). However, since something like an ai is so different from me, it having a conscious experience might present totally differently. 

While this might be a silly question, I do think our definition of what makes something conscious is worth exploring as our technology continues to improve. Perhaps we will get to a point where ai has a human-like or human-level of experience and then learn it had some form of subjective experience from the start.",Can we prove (or do we have strong compelling evidence) that computers/ai don't have some form of consciousness?,askphilosophy

I don't necessarily mean something enthusiastically chosen, I merely mean anything that doesn't work like race: stamping an identity on someone regardless of whether they ""perform"" or not. Let's summon Heidegger and Satre to help me out here.  Following the latter, for example, I may choose to become a programmer but I am irreducible to being-a-programmer. I am not a programmer in the same sense that a rock is a rock. I am a programmer because I continually choose to incarnate that role and through the course of my free existence I might throw that away.                 

On Heidegger:              

&gt;The basic idea of ontic guilt \[not relevant here\] is that Dasein \[we can take Dasein to mean ""human beings"" to understand this quote\], **as existing, must** project itself upon a possibility or possibilities of Being of some kind or another. This projection belongs to what it is to exist and is thus constitutive of Dasein's very Being (p. 185). Thus, for example, Dasein can project itself upon the possibility of Being a student or a policeman.                  

There doesn't seem to be much difference in the performativity of being-a-cop or being-a-teacher and the performativity of being-a-trans-girl. To prove this further, I am going to be a bit sardonic here and directly alter the Judith Butler section on Britannica:      

&gt; One of her [innovations](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovations) was to suggest that teaching is [constituted](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constituted) by action and speech‚Äîby behaviour in which teaching traits and [dispositions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dispositions) are exhibited or acted out. In particular, professorship is not an underlying essence or nature of which professor behaviour is the product;   It is a series of acts whose constant repetition creates the [illusion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/illusion) that an underlying nature exists.  Teaching, according to Butler, ‚Äúis performatively constituted by the very ‚Äòexpressions‚Äô that are said to be its results.‚Äù  

This seems somewhat like a pleonasm, doesn't it? It doesn't do much other than restating ""gender is not innate"", which is hardly an innovative piece of theory for explaining trans experience.                     

Now, I should at least concede that what comes afterward is more interesting:            

&gt; She stressed, however, that individuals do not exist prior to or independently of the genders they ‚Äúperform‚Äù: ‚Äúgender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to preexist the deed.‚Äù Indeed, ‚Äúthe ‚Äòdoer‚Äô is variably constructed in and through the deed.‚Äù Individual identity (the subject) is itself performatively constituted. It follows that individuals do not ‚Äúchoose‚Äù their genders and cannot assume or [discard](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/discard) or radically alter them at will simply by behaving (or not behaving) in certain ways.  

I am not exactly fond of this tirade against subject philosophy, but let's ignore it. Is this sufficient for a fully specific account of gender? Though there are not many other phenomena like this, I can name at least one: one could say the same things about religion. This is somewhat a startling conception for most people who take religion to be simply an inner conviction, but for someone like Hegel who explains religion through the formative influence of outer/social ritual, it is easily understood. Moreover, Hegel is taking off from Luther's sacramental theology where holy acts make God's presence manifest on Earth.                     

Religion is an inner conviction formed through ritual which cannot be simply discarded and gender is an inner conviction formed through behavior which cannot be simply discarded. Then what is their difference? It's not enough to just empirically describe the obvious differences, as one might be tempted to do: the theory itself must make them follow from the concept of gender.",How informative is Butler's concept of perfomativity?,askphilosophy

‚ÄúFor the Madhyamaka school conceiving of substances as individuals instantiating properties is deeply unsatisfactory. For the sake of illustration (and using an Indian example) assume a substantially real, fundamental entity the only property of which is being spatially extended. Now what is the individual in which this property inheres? As it is not characterized by any other properties it must be some kind of propertyless bare particular. What makes it a bare particular? Given that we are dealing with substances here it should not depend on some other object. But if it is a bare particular by svabhƒÅva and being a bare particular is therefore its intrinsic nature we are in the same situation as we were with the spatially extended entity. For now we can ask what the individual is in which being a bare particular inheres, and then we are well on our way into an infinite regress. Note that this problem does not got away if we feel uneasy about the property ‚Äòbeing a bare particular‚Äô and do not want to admit it. For we have to assume that the individual has some determinate nature due to which it is a bearer of its properties and the difficulty will just reappear with whatever we take such a nature to be.‚Äù

So Nagarjuna rejects the idea that the entities considered as the bearers of properties can be the real substances we seek, but this argument doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. If we take an entity whose only property is being spatially extended, then of course the bearer of that spatial extension must be a bare particular. But then why ask what the individual which has the property of a bare particular is? If it‚Äôs a bare particular, then we would have reached an end point right?

194,"Hi,

reading Richard Swinburne's probabilistic case for God, I noticed two things: first, when talking about the existence of God, he takes that the a priori/prior probability of the God hypothesis is conditioned only to the simplicity of the sad hypothesis and no other data. The reason here is that since God is supposed to be the explanation for the whole universe, then anything entailed by ""the universe"" will be in the realm of evidence, thus couldn't fit the a priori variable. And that makes sense to me. On a second occasion, when he is talking about the probability that Jesus was raised by God from the dead, he says that the a priori variable of that hypothesis depends on the probability that God exists and that He would want to raise Jesus from the dead for some reason. So, if we think that is likely that God exists and that he has good reasons to raise Jesus under certain conditions (e.g. he being God Incarnate), then the a priori probability will be high. And that also makes sense to me.

Now with all that in mind, what I would like to know is: *how can he know which are the variables that count when defining the calculation of the a priori probability*? In the examples above, how can I know if Swinburne is not missing something in either of the two cases? You know, maybe there is something missing in there and I can't see, maybe there are other factors that should be computed in defining how to calculate those a priori variables and I'm just not seeing it  (nor Swinburne apparently). How could I know?

Consider a different scenario where the answer to my question could apply. Suppose I'm discussing the moral virtue of a certain politician: maybe I want to know if he is corrupt, or if he plans to do a coup d'etat, or if he is a member of a questionable society (maybe the Freemasons), or if my conspiracist friend is right in saying he is likely a member of a questionable secret society that may not even exist (Illuminatti, reptilians, etc.). In such a case, how could I derive the variables involved in estimating the prior probability of such a hypothesis?

Falsificationists often criticize induction on the grounds that it presupposes some ""uniformity of nature"" which cannot be justified. They consider their approach superior because it relies on no such thing, but only deductive logic. But can falsificaionist really serve as a ground for science without also assuming uniformity?

Let's say we hypothesis some law of nature X that we want to test. The falsificationist will subject X to a test. If that test comes out false, then according to them X has been refuted (is false), so the story goes.

But, if we do not assume that nature has any uniformity, then couldn't this single falsification be just a random ""fluke""? That is, maybe X does indeed hold at all other times and places, but it failed this one time due to nature not being uniform. In that case, what has the test, and the falsificationist, really accomplished? They can't say that X is usually or always false, or is a bad predictor, etc . It is false only in the technical sense in that one instance of it turned out to be false, but this is uninteresting and unhelpful from a scientific perspective, where we already accept fallibilism. It seems if the falsificationist really wants to refute X is any interesting or useful sense, they would need to infer that this failed test means other such tests would also fail, which is exactly the kind of inductive inference they are criticizing!

For comparison: imagine we are interested in how many members of a certain population have caught a disease. All the falsificationist can do is look for one person who doesn't have the disease to refute the hypothesis that everyone has it. On the other hand, the inductivist can take a sample of the population to find the proportion who have it, and extrapolate to the whole population. This is fallible, certainly, but it is at least useful, where the falsification approach doesn't seem useful in the slightest

223,"Some ways of understanding the world seem to have two methodological commitments: everything within a given system / set of systems is explanatorily connected to everything else, and there is some central dynamic that is driving the system, and all explanations of why things happen in the system must ultimately be phrased in terms of this central dynamic.

The cause of my confusion is that the best word I can find for methodological commitment #1 seems to is 'holism', and for commitment #2, 'reductionism', even though the two are often quoted as opposites. But I nevertheless find this approach to explaining the world to be very common.

An example of such a methodology is Marxism. Marxism holds that 'history is the history of class struggle', so all explanations of why things happen, even down to stuff like 'why are streets wider than they used to be', are explained in terms of the central historical materialist process of modes of production superceding each other by means of class struggle, etc. (in the case of streets, it is argued that streets are wide to prevent barricades. True in Paris - I doubt its true in general). Marxism and Hegelianism are often taken as paradigm cases of holism, in that they argue that society must be explained as a whole *first*, in terms of the dynamics of that whole (whether that's Geist or class struggle), before we understand society's constituent parts. This is counterposed to the alleged reductionism of liberalism, which seeks to understand people as individuals first, then combine them together to understand society.

Is there a word for this style of explanation, or discussions of it? Not holism / reductionism, but something else. If I could boil it down into a sentence, its that 'everything in a system is explained by reference to one central process'. A word I've been toying in my head is 'explanatory monism' - for a given system, explanations are singular and interconnected. Its opposite might be 'explanatory pluralism', that there might be many types explanations for different things within a system. E.g. class struggle might explain labour vs. capital share of profit, but a human preference for open space or on-street parking or whatever mostly explains street width, etc.

I want to be able to name a phenomenon that I see quite often, particularly among the politically or religiously minded. Its 'when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail' writ large. Everything is explained by class struggle, by the illuminati, by god, and all explanations for everything relate back to each other.

227,"This is related to an argument (I hesitate to call it a ""debate"") I had IRL lately. The other person felt very strongly my position on what it is to be an artist is wrong, and it is their field, so I feel it is likely there is something to their position. However, it was clearly emotive for us and neither of us were really able to get past that to make points in a way the other understood as a result. It turned bitter, but the other person is someone I care about (a family member who lives abroad and who I therefore only see rarely), and I want to understand what they were trying to say. In that respect this question is a bit of ""change-my-view"" type thing, with the caveat that I don't really want to change my view; I just want understand the their opinion.

The debate was regarding whether video games could be art. I believe they can be and are art. My opponent felt very strongly that wasn't the case, and that asserting as much was disrespectful for actual artists.

The case made to me was this:

1. There is a distinction between what is art and what is not.
2. The difference between the two is based on the consensus of what is called the ""art world"" - these are people already recognised as artists and people recognised as critics.
3. While minority research exists to understand video games as an artistic product this is at an extremely early stage.
4. A consensus takes time to develop and cannot be said to exist on the basis of the small amount of evidence available.
5. Therefore video games do not qualify as art at the present time, and may never do.
6. Therefore none of the people who make video games qualify as artists and it is demeaning to the actual artists in the art world to refer to any of them as such.
7. [Separately to the other points] Games lack an art-historical context, and therefore can't be considered art.

Unfortunately I wasn't really able to get much further than this, as the debate became seriously heated quite quickly and we both ended up rage-quitting.

My main questions, objections, and comments to this - which I was hoping you could enlighten me on - are:

- Is this not Argument from Authority in disguise, with the ""art world"" the designated authority? If it is argument from authority, does that actually undermine it? (It's not a formal-logic proposition, after all, and authorities with the power to define things do exist in reality.)

- Is 3. really the case? I seem to remember this debate happening about 10 years ago and resulting several bodies officially recognising games as art, including some actual museums. Additionally I was linked to a 2012 talk by Grayson Perry about the limitations of what art isn't which I was told would convince my video games aren't art. It didn't convince me and in the Q&amp;A session afterwards he said ""the modern Sistine Chapel is probably being made in a digital studio by very skillful programmers, computer animators and game designers working on the apogee of 21st Century creativity."" That seems to suggest video games are considered art in the art world, unless Grayson Perry is an eccentric in his views here. (Is he? I wouldn't know.)

- What actually is an art-historical context? Video games have been around for a while now (the first title sold to the public was 1958) - is that long enough to have historical context? And art museums have done exhibits on video games. Is that an artistic context? What is an art-historical context if neither of those things?

- How does the art world theory work if we were to meet, say, aliens who clearly had their own traditions around things which strongly resemble art, but is otherwise incomprehensible to us?

&gt; On this last point I see two possible resolutions to this: the first is that the art world is, in fact, a collection of independent (though likely heavily overlapping) art worlds, with each world having jurisdiction over a particular genre. (E.g. the ""heavy metal art world"" decides whether a piece of music is heavy metal or not but has no say over whether it is hip-hop or not, which is decided by the ""hip-hop art world"".) The theory could then recognise the alien culture has having their own art world to decide whether any given piece of work is art. If this interpretation is correct is this theory still useful? And could video games be said to have their own art world deciding if any given game is art?

&gt; On the other hand if the art world is an exclusive group could deny the right for alien creations to be recognised as art (regardless of its qualities), isn't this terribly jingoistic? I see parallels in the way certain types of music reviewers used to claim rap (and more generally, urban music as a whole) wasn't ""really music"" by some arbitrary standards that were, in hindsight, probably a kind of subconscious racism. (For clarity: my opponent here is very much **not** racist.) I am also reminded of arguments in favour of slavery which made the case that those being enslaved were uncultured (does ""uncultured"" mean ""lacking any artistic appreciation or ability"" when applied to a race or civilisation?) which were popular both with pro-Slavery groups in America, but was also used in ancient Athens as one of many justifications for keeping many ""barbarians"" (i.e. non-Greeks, in this context) as slaves. Is this a reasonable comparison? While this last point objection doesn't necessarily invalidate the theory, it certainly makes me skeptical.

- If the art world is exclusive in that way, isn't there a prime-mover problem? How did it start? And why couldn't other art worlds start the same way?

- Is it reasonable to expect those outside the art world to respect the decisions of the art world if they disagree with it, and cease to refer to particular works as ""art"" or particular people as ""artists"" if the non-art-world people wish to do so?

If you can comment or answer even a small part of this post I welcome your insight and hope that I can better understand the case made to me earlier this week.

228,"I am trying to go a very fine-grained reading of *Being and Time* Division 1, Chapter 3 and I'm trying to sort out the relations between various structural aspects of worldliness. 

So far, I understand that useful things \[Zeuge\] have their particular handiness \[zuhandenheit\] in relation to a referential chain that leads back to Dasein as the ultimate for-the-sake-of-which, and to a totality of all other useful things relevant within that referential chain (an ""equipment totality""). Spatially, this also means that the handiness of useful things determines their place \[Platz\] within a ""positional totality"" of all the places of the useful things within the equipment totality.

My confusion regards the role of the region \[Gegend\]. Heidegger says that the region is that *in which* the positional totality is related to the equipment totality, and is the condition for their possibility. He also says that regions are always already at hand in individual places. 

I've looked at a couple commentaries and they seem to gloss over the specific distinctions and instead focus on Heidegger's critique of Cartesian spatiality (which I feel like I already grasp pretty well).

233,"Okay, so using reductio ad absurdem might tear down an argument based in universals, but what if the position just slightly adjusts to accommodate? Here's the example that has been stumping me:

My friend is an adamant utilitarian, but only to the extent that it is a ""general framework."" To put it simply, he thinks utilitarianism is valid except for when it isn't valid, but he thinks that is perfectly fine because he merely defers these exceptions to some other unknown theory/explanation that might take its place. For example, given his logic, slavery would be justified so long as it resulted in maximized happiness. Because this conflicts with his intuitive understanding of morality, however, he just calls that an exception and moves on, believing that something complicated like that falls under the realm of a different theory/system.

This is where I'm experiencing confusion and dissonance. A similar parallel to this, I think, is ""X religious book is the arbiter of morality...except when it isn't."" AKA, let's follow everything it says, except for when we don't want to and we'll just ignore what it says. Well, doesn't that...strip its credibility? What makes his general utilitarianism argument any more justified than a 'general &lt;religious book&gt;' argument? Why can't we just say ""let's listen to and abide by what Jon down the road says, except for when we disagree?""

Meanwhile, if someone says ""hey, unborn fetuses can be aborted up until the point that they have a nose. Once they have a nose, they're human and can't be killed."" If you point to an exception, other known as an example of someone who is clearly human but lacks a nose, that would theoretically dismantle this argument, right? Using the nose as a basis for determining personhood is ridiculous. Well, then they say ""my argument is merely general and doesn't include exceptions, so it is still valid."" ...

On the other hand, and sorry for using a politically charged example, but there are various criteria someone might use to define what a woman is biologically. Chromosomes, ability to give birth, genitalia, etc., yet...there's exceptions to these biological definitions where you'd be able to find someone understood to be a woman who doesn't have any of these criteria. In that case, it seems like the definition of woman is operating not as a universal, but rather a near-universal? But what makes this definition any different from my friend's point about utilitarianism? ""The definition is great except for when it isn't.""

He usually doesn't give very strong, if any, justification for his statements, but rather just states his theory, without explaining how he got there, as if it is self evident. The few times he does give an argument with real premises and a conclusion, the argument is often not even valid.

6,"Take a democratic debate for instance. In a public state of strong division between indiviuals, peace can be lost. To regain peace we can open up discussion and each party try to make compromises so that an agreement can be reached. But then, each party have started to resemble a little bit more the others. Have we lost something in the process? The differences that caused the argument in the first place might be seen as riches.  
Furthermore this story can be generalized to all types of situation where people change and become more like the ones surrounding them, thus gaining a more peaceful atmosphere but throwing some of their indivicual cultural content away.

Definition of a ""man"" as a ""two-legged animal"" should not be taken to be a complex definition of a singular essence of being a man. That is, the essence of man is a simple and singular thing and it is only our English language restrictions that force this definition to be a complex phrase ""two-legged animal"". That is a man is not the intersection of two more simpler genus/classes -- class of two legged things intersected with the class of animals.

First of All, I am a non-philosopher. I am a software engineer in Pakistan and an atheist.

So following the question in the title, what is it that makes some famous philosophers say such a thing? Is a supernatural deity the only source of meaning?  
Does the naturalistic point of view, that life starts at birth and ends at death and there's nothing more to it, make life completely meaningless?
Does it logically follow that a finite life cannot be a meaningful life (Considering that the afterlife gives most people's lives meaning)?

I don't know. I am not well read in philosophical literature. But I do have experience of living. And I can tell that my life is meaningful.

19,"Hi!

I've come across a few instances which explain cognitive dissonance as, for instance, the ambivalent feelings towards smoking. I use this example mainly because I am not a smoker so I have no bone to pick with it.


Specifically I am interested in:
&gt;The study Patterns of Cognitive Dissonance-reducing Beliefs Among Smokers indicated that smokers use justification beliefs to reduce &gt;their cognitive dissonance about smoking tobacco and the negative consequences of smoking it.


&gt;To reduce cognitive dissonance, the participant smokers adjusted their beliefs to correspond with their actions:

&gt;Functional beliefs (""Smoking calms me down when I am stressed or upset.""; ""Smoking helps me concentrate better.""; ""Smoking is an &gt;important part of my life.""; and ""Smoking makes it easier for me to socialize."")
&gt;Risk-minimizing beliefs (""The medical evidence that smoking is harmful is exaggerated.""; ""One has to die of something, so why not ?&gt;enjoy yourself and smoke?""; and ""Smoking is no more risky than many other things people do."")

My question is this: are we to draw the conclusion that there is no rationally tenable justification for smoking? Are all rationalizations that arise from cognitive dissonance invalid by their nature? 

If both of these are answered in the affirmative, then we can further conclude that any action which constitutes a risk to our health, despite possible advantages, are irrational because we are aware (consciously or not) that the risk to our health exists.

In another instance also using the smoking example, they claimed:
&gt; Some may give the justification that they don't mind the risk of smoking because they are fine with possibly living a shorter life, but this is untrue: they wish to live a long life.

Does this mean that, to be a rational human, one must live a life free from risk and danger -- and any foray into the wilderness, so to speak, is unjustifiable by rational standards? Dessert, travel, sports, lack of exercise, drug experimentation, social drinking? Does this eliminate any viability to the philosophy, values, priorities and goals of an individual if they include seemingly sound explanations for the importance of risk? Is it an unsound rationalization (manifested by cognitive dissonance) to say that one is willing to take occasional risks for a more enriching life even though there are chances that life may be shortened as a consequence of this risk?

I hope that I managed to make my muddled thinking clear enough, and that my perturbation is not a consequence of unchained obsessive compulsive rumination.

How exactly does one tell secondary concievability? In the entry, I‚Äôm unclear on the meaning of how counterfactual is being used.

&gt; The second constraint binds what is true at other possible worlds to facts about how things actually are. As Chalmers explains, that captures a kind of subjunctive possibility. Since chemical composition is arguably essential to substances, such as water, it is not secondarily conceivable that water is not H2O. As Chalmers also puts it, secondary conceivability amounts to coherently conceiving the situation described as counterfactual, namely as a way the world might have been, given how our world is.

What does it mean to coherently describe the situation as counterfactual?

Does that entail conceiving of the situation given certain facts about the world that are a posteriori knowable? For instance, given certain a posteriori knowable propositions about water and chemical substances (e.g. chemical formula is essential to physical/chemical properties), it is inconceivable that water is anything other than H2O. Secondary concievability is hence a posteriori.

For primary concievability, if no facts that are a priori knowable contradict a proposition, then that proposition is primarily conceivable; hence possible.

In principle, classical utilitarianism allows for the killing of any individual so long as their existence is replaced with another individual that is equally happy, all outside factors being the same.   
Singer's preference utilitarianism allows for the killing of any individual cognitively incapable of having a preference for survival so long as their existence is replaced with another individual that has equal preference satisfaction, all outside factors being the same.   
While Singer's approach is an improvement over classical utilitarianism in this aspect, It still seems intuitively obvious to me that beings who can have morally relevant preferences, just not a preference for survival, can't just be replaced with nothing of value being lost.   

Has there been a further adaption of utilitarianism that is in line with this intuition?

49,"In Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses, in the section titled ""Ideology is a ‚ÄòRepresentation‚Äô of the Imaginary Relationship of Individuals to their Real Conditions of Existence"" Althusser brings up two distinct theses. 

1.  Ideology represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence. 
2.  Ideology has a material existence. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really understand the difference between them and the relation between subjects and their ideology in the different thesis. 

In the second thesis he says:

 

\&gt;An individual believes in God, or Duty, or Justice, etc. This belief derives (for everyone, i.e. for all those &gt;who live in an ideological representation of ideology, which reduces ideology to ideas endowed by &gt;definition with a spiritual existence) from the ideas of the individual concerned, i.e. from him as a &gt;subject with a consciousness which contains the ideas of his belief. In this way, i.e. by means of the &gt;absolutely ideological ‚Äòconceptual‚Äô device (*dispositif*) thus set up (a subject endowed with a &gt;consciousness in which he freely forms or freely recognizes ideas in which he believes), the (material) &gt;attitude of the subject concerned naturally follows.

\&gt;The individual in question behaves in such and such a way, adopts such and such a practical attitude, &gt;and, what is more, participates in certain regular practices which are those of the ideological &gt;apparatus on which ‚Äòdepend‚Äô the ideas which he has in all consciousness freely chosen as a subject. If &gt;he believes in God, he goes to Church to attend Mass, kneels, prays, confesses, does penance (once it &gt;was material in the ordinary sense of the term) and naturally repents and so on. If he believes in &gt;Duty, he will have the corresponding attitudes, inscribed in ritual practices ‚Äòaccording to the correct &gt;principles‚Äô. If he believes in Justice, he will submit unconditionally to the rules of the Law, and may &gt;even protest when they are violated, sign petitions, take part in a demonstration, etc.

The standard path has been the academic system, but I‚Äôve had rough experiences with education and don‚Äôt fully believe in it or the direction it‚Äôs headed. The problem is that I‚Äôm aware that a PhD program at a top university is likely the best route for discussion and criticism currently. I‚Äôve been mimicking university course structures and taking notes at home, which has been more natural and as productive as many of the undergrad philosophy courses I‚Äôve taken, but the lack of criticism worries me. It seems very easy to form ideas in a bubble. Is there a viable path for a useful, modern philosophy without joining the university system? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! EDIT: Thanks everyone for the responses‚Äîthey‚Äôve been very helpful! It seems like my concern of criticism is a valid one and something that needs to be addressed if considering a non-academic route. I‚Äôll likely take some time to work through my options to see what my plan will be moving forward. One argument for the university system is that many, if not all, philosophers of significance have come from an academic background. While this may be true, my rebuttal would be that many, if not all, philosophers of significance have come from a world without the internet. I know the internet isn‚Äôt a 1-to-1 replacement for the education system, but it‚Äôs opened a new avenue for learning that wasn‚Äôt available to aspiring philosophers even 50 years ago.

111,"I have been interested in ethics for a few years now, but I've only taken a few philosophy classes, read some books, and some papers, so I am still very ignorant. A question that keeps coming up for me is how can morality ever be objective. For instance, say I am some sort of utilitarian and believe that the only thing that can be said to be 'bad' is pain. This, especially after reading Introduction to the Principles... by Bentham, is the position that I hold. That means that I think it is wrong to cause people pain. I do believe that pain is bad and that causing pain is bad but what if someone else doesn't believe this? ""Well,"" you may say, ""there are people that don't believe the earth is round, but it still is. Or, you may just be wrong.""

To respond to the former: Yes, but we can know that those people are wrong by proving the earth is round (unless of course we deny our perceptions etc. but that isn't my point). So give me \*that\* proof for why this moral theory is objectively right. The world being round is outside of our subjective opinions, so our subjective opinions don't matter. Until I know that ethics is outside of our subjective opinions I can't say that someone disagreeing with me is a bad rebuttal. 

The latter: Okay, prove to me which one is objectively right.

This is by no means a challenge. I am not trying to sound pretentious at all. I am genuinely asking.

Now, you might say: ""ImmoratalScrunchie, great name by the way,"" (thanks :D) ""I think you would be \*rather\* perturbed if I murdered your family."" And yes, yes I would. I think murder and many other things are HORRIBLE. And I would risk my life (or at least I hope I would) to save someone from being hurt. I am not saying that I wouldn't. But that doesn't make it objective. Just because you threaten the life of my loved one and I do everything I can to stop you doesn't mean that I am objectively right, it just means that I don't want you to kill my family.

The other question I have is about God. Say there was a God that existed, why are their commands objective? (A guy named Plato stole this question from me a few thousand years ago, wanker). 

I can see how someone can be inconsistent \*within\* their own moral theory. They can contradict themselves etc. That isn't what I am talking about. I am asking why their moral theory is worthy of being objectively followed as fact in the first place.

The only way that I (which isn't saying much lol) can come up with a way that morality is objective is if it flows necessarily from something we already know is objective fact. Can we a priori prove morals? Are \*any\* normative statements a priori justifiable? If there are I would really like to know because that seems very interesting. If there are not then that means morality would have to deductively follow from positive claims. But I don't see how you can have all positive premises and then somehow get to a normative conclusion (unless I'm just stupid and you can). 

I'm currently reading Four Faces of Moral Realism by Finlay, Reasons and Persons (I'll continue when I can find a copy that's spine isn't falling off), and am about to pick up The Moral Problem by Smith and The Myth of Morality by Joyce. Are these reputable books that will help me understand, or are they not taken seriously by academics? What other books/papers should I read?

On the stylistic side, analytic philosophy would be on the more logically formal, epistemically cautious end, and would rather be practiced in the form of concise articles pertaining to a particular subject rather than trying to build near all-encompassing systems. On the contextual side, well it looks to me as if the two traditions, if they can be called as such, mainly just ignores one another, resulting in them not having the same references. Also, if what makes one a continental is simply that they're not an analytic, well it sounds like a useless label? It would group together schools that have pretty much nothing in common.

But seeing how it's such a widely used disctinction, maybe there really is some fundamental difference between analytic and continental that justifies it?

I'm understanding Habermas as a part of the critical social sciences with the emancipatory project he outlined in knowledge and human interests... He sees communication (communicative action) and intersubjective reason as the vehicle for the emancipation of the reflective subject or whatever right?

So I'm outlining other critical social scientists with similar post-Marx (as in literally AFTER Marx) claims to emancipation.

Adorno plays a big role since Hab was a critical theorist...

Now negative dialectics, I keep reading the same words over and over and looking at different explanations, but it isn't clicking. I haven't read Hegel or Kant and I'm vaguely familiar with the Stanford Philosophy encyclopedia articles lol. I understand the Marxist dialectic, and I kinda get Hegels idea of finding out more about stuff via the negation of he negation , but I don't understand the ""non identity"" in Adorno. I think he's outling something about freedom from domination, the present, nonpositivity, but I don't understand what he's actually getting at or how these concepts connect towards adorno's intellectual programme. 

I understand the historical context of totalitarianism and ideology, i understand adorno's other sociological stuff (mass culture), but I still don't understand exactly what a negative dialectic is, I don't understand how to break it down on simple terms (which to me is most important) and I don't understand how negative dialectics can be used to end domination.

138,"This is a strange philosophical question while I was thinking about the nature of npcs in video games. For non-programmers, amusingly, npcs don't really 'exist' in the game unless the player is directly looking at them. In video games, really, nothing exists unless the player is currently looking at it. Its a bit of a joke in the programming community really. For instance, Mario doesn't actually move left or right, when you press the left or right button everything else simply moves in the opposite direction to create the illusion that he's moving. This is because the world doesn't exist beyond the screen; Mario is unmoving because he's always in the center of the screen. Things that appear on screen don't have coordinates for the world, they have coordinates for where they exist on screen. Mario doesn't move, because his y-axis (normally) doesn't change, only everything else does. 

This results in some amusing non-sense even in more modern titles. For instance, there's a character in Skyrim called 'Balbus' who tends to suffer from a rather unfortunate glitch. Normally when an NPC randomly appears in an area, such as Balbus, they're removed once the player leaves the area. Balbus, however, is not, due to an over-sight by the programmers. Thus when you return to the spot where you last met him, he'll still be there, and unfortunately for him since the player re-entered the area the game will spawn in new npcs on his location (typically a pack of wolves), leading to his demise. The amusing part about this, is this NEVER happens off-screen; the player always pays witness to this. This is because, again, like goombas in the Mario games, Balbus simply doesn't exist unless the player is directly looking at him. Nothing is happening to him, he doesn't animate, move, nothing. The game simply has it set to spawn in a new copy of him whenever the player returns to the spot where they met him.

Though this got me thinking about the nature of what it means to 'exist'. Balbus for instance is never completely gone; he does have coordinates on the game map telling where he should appear when the player approaches him, and this can be baked into the save file itself assuming the player saved after they met him. Also, either way he does have data in the game's files, such as the mesh for his head, and the data that determines his stats and equipment and whatnot. That's always in the game even if the player doesn't see him. Heck, its there even if Balbus has moved on (yet again), or even if the game or computer itself is completely turned off (though if the computer is off, it does technically disappear from the RAM). 

This has all got me thinking; what does it mean to really 'exist'? Does Balbus exist? Yeah, he's a fictional character, but he does have a representation in the physical world, namely the 1s and 0s that comprise his code. An action figure of a fictional character does in fact exist in physical reality, the fact that it depicts a fictional character is irrelevant to the matter.

Though this does leave a question; what *is* Balbus? Is he the ephemeral pixels on the screen? Is he his files in the Skyrim program? He is the code that's in the RAM? Is he his head mesh? What about his sound files? What is Balbus in reality? Can it be said that Balbus does in a way 'exist'? I mean, if he was a piece in a board game, that would obviously exist, but does a digital character 'exist'? Characters that appear in books normally aren't said to exist, but you can still give them properties; they take the form of text, ink on paper, that always has a specific configuration unique to the character, such as their name. Digital data *is* a physical thing, and like text can represent a character. Is Balbus different because he can actually interact with the physical world, such as by making pixels light up in specific colors and in a specific configuration on the screen, or when he makes sound waves emanate from the player's speaker or headphones? In light of does, do characters from live action movies 'exist'? The actor obviously did, and the character does have a physical form in an image on film strip. Of course, these days movies are just binary data too. Does this change the matter? Does a fictional character that appears on a film strip exist, but one that appears in a digital copy of the movie does not? 

At least a book character has a rather tenuous connection to physical reality; they can't really interact with the physical world in anyway unlike characters in movies or video games (unless the ink that comprises them does something to the paper anyway). Does it really make a difference though if the fictional character has an actual physical representation of some kind that you can see? 

Really though, you think about it, if digital characters can be said to 'exist', then why not thoughts? They have a physical representation in our world, in the form of neurons. They may not really take the form we imagine them to have, but they are still a part of physical reality. Thoughts are normally said to 'exist', so why not a fictional character who also happens to be a thought? 

How do you really define what 'exists' and what does not? Paintings are real, action figures are real, but characters who appear in the form of text do not. What about characters who are binary data, or simply a thought in someone's head? Aren't all literary characters though a thought in the reader's mind, a copy that's unique to them that their mind constructed from ink seen on a piece of paper, like a program de-compressing a zip-file?

I can easily imagine someone never explicitly asserting ‚Äúvoting is good‚Äù (even silently, to themselves) yet still engaging in the act of voting.  This seems to indicate that the person has an implicit belief, and that this implicit belief plays an explanatory role for their act of voting.  

In aanother case, someone might vote in one election but not another.  This could be down to the messiness of life (couldn‚Äôt get away from work, whatever) but if implicit or unarticulated beliefs *always* play an explanatory role in actions, does this mean that the person holds two contradictory beliefs, ie ‚Äúvoting is good‚Äù and ‚Äúvoting is bad‚Äù?

However, the explanation of their voting could also be some urge or instinct or desire, or anything else that would not count as an articulated assertion along the lines of ‚Äúvoting is good.‚Äù  This possibility seems to indicate that just because someone votes, we cannot then conclude that they hold a belief or assertion about voting.

I struggle to stay interested for long periods of time in topics and fields that I consider less interesting, but those that people would consider crucial (or at least the bare minimum, I suppose) to being a decent philosopher.

Thus, there should be properties such as baldness, hairiness, tallness, thinness etc. which are in themselves vague.

But I hear it is a very popular position in metaphysics that there can't be vague objects. This is probably due to [Evans' notoriously short argument](http://astrofrelat.fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar/filosofia_cientifica/media/papers/Evans-Can_There_Be_Vague_Objects_.pdf): if there were vague objects, then there would be x and y such that x = y is of indeterminate truth-value. But (very much determinately) x = x, and thus by a few steps of abstraction and Leibniz's law, determinately ~(x = y). So, by reductio, there are no vague objects.

Assuming this argument is sound and manages to establish its conclusion -- I know it has its critics, but let's set that aside --, I wonder if a similar case can be mounted against vague properties. Assuming properties *are* objects in the sense Evans is thinking about, then the adaptation is straightforward. It could also go like this: if there are vague properties, then there is F and G such that indeterminately F = G. This seems to entail it is indeterminate whether Fx iff Gx for any x. But (very much determinately) Fx iff Fx. By similar steps of abstraction and substituon, ~(F = G). There can't be vague properties either.

I think the effects of this are pretty evident as well: classical and modern philosophy gets discussed a lot more than what comes in-between, and when newcomers ask questions here it seems to also mostly fall in the former.

So my question is: why is this? Is it because the middle ages just kind of rehash a lot of classical philosophy without adding much new? Or is it because of some (historical) biases that made philosophy educators dismiss it? Maybe a mix of both?

A variation of this problem was given by Derek Parfit. My question is, on that day, just before the night where I or my clone is about to be transported or teleported to the moon, should I really care whether I get cloned and die before my clone gets teleported, or if I don't die and get transported to the moon in my sleep? What difference does it make whether the original me continues on or a clone with the same memories continues on in existence? After all, for all I know the person typing this question may not be the same person who I remember myself being last night. I too might just be a clone of him. The physical material in our body always changes anyway, it's only a certain pattern that stays constant.

The assumption here is that the child is supposed to want this relationship but it is inherently not consensual since the child is not given the choice for whether to be part of this type of relationship or not, it is all on the parent.","Is a parent-child relationship the only non-consensual one, similar to arranged marriages?",askphilosophy

Heidegger translates _al√™theia_ to German not as _wahrheit_, truth, but as _unverborgenheit_, unconcealment.

In _The Origin of the Work of Art_, Heidegger claims that art is a method for creating truth, and this is where I'm lost. Is Heidegger's concept of truth not correspondent? Is it propositional? Such that something is true if consistent with existing propositions? This doesn't seem at all right.

Butler goes on to claim ‚Äúit remains politically important to represent women, but to do that in a way that does not distort and refit the very collectivity the theory is supposed to emancipate‚Äù and that ‚Äúthere is nothing about a binary gender system that is given‚Äù; the main point seems to be that gender is an entirely performative and socially coerced act that, while serving some social functions, is ultimately oppressive and limiting to the individual, and we must be careful in fighting for equality for women not to validate the metaphysical concept of woman itself. That is, to rectify inequality that‚Äôs come about on the basis of one‚Äôs being a woman, you must simultaneously do away with the concept of women and identify the individual woman. This is a reasonable project, however it seems these ideas can be applied to many identities. One is not born educated, born wealthy, born into a position of authority, or even born popular, but, rather, becomes all these things. Should we similarly do away with these concepts and titles which are, roughly, performative social acts that don‚Äôt express a corresponding underlying essence? The answer in some cases seem much more complicated than in others, in particular popularity amongst peers, not reflecting any underlying essence of the individual, affords tremendous privilege.

Not only that but there's a straight up eugenics program. We learn the language and try talking to the poor but they see it as their moral duty to the planet and well being of society.

Hi! So a few days ago I made a post here titled, ""why shouldn't I be an egoist?"" (https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/wfe5fk/why_shouldnt_i_be_an_egoist/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and almost every response that I got made me think my notion of egoism may be wrong, or at least different from what most people here have it mind. Basically, I used to be a fan of Ayn Rand years ago, before I started studying philosophy academically. But some form of egoism is one thing from my ""objectivist"" days that I believe still contributes to my life. So I wanted to know, ""why not?"" Though I felt that the objections I got we're largely irrelevant to my own beliefs.

Here are a few ethical propositions I believe:

1. Values are functions of properties, not properties themselves. There is no such thing as anything being valuable except in relation to a valuative entity (agent relativism).
2. All values are partial to the entities from which they extend. Meaning, when the valuative entity extends concern, care, or importance to somethings outside itself, their value reduces to they're own state of being as it relates to the object; their state of being is predicated on the state of the object. (I think of this as ontological egoism: the nature of a value is such that it partially predicates the well-being of one object on the possession/state of another. Any value for anything is ultimately an extension of a value an agent has for its own state of being.)
3. The moral good for each agent is always in accordance with their own good. 'We should always do what is truly good for us and nothing more,' is Adler's maxim, which I think sums up my view pretty well (btw, I honestly don't understand why Adler doesn't consider himself an egoist).

Just to be clear, I do not subscribe myself to the view that each agent should merely act in their self-interest. I believe that each agent should do what is really good for them. And that will necessarily involve distinguishing between self-interests that are good for the agent, and self-interests that are bad.

So here are a few more propositions I believe to be true:

1. Not only are individuals a part of a social system, their social system is a part of them. Their language, world-views, skills and abilities, all gifted to them by the society to which they belong, form the identity of the agent and contribute to its nature as a social animal. The identity of every self is in part formed by the identity of other selves, so we are all connected to others insofar as others contribute to the nature of our own existence. 
2. What is good for individual humans, via their natures as social creatures, is to sustain and promote the well-being of other life-forms, especially other humans. (This doesn't just mean charity is good because it feels good psychologically in the moment of the act. Sometimes it really doesn't, sometimes it feels better to stay at home and sleep in. Charity is especially good in these moments because it contributes to the habits necessary for forming a good social character, which is ultimately in accordance with the agent's conitus).

So **I believe one should be extensively other-regarding**, but only insofar as it is truly good for oneself. Is that egoism?",Am I an Egoist?,askphilosophy

10,"I recently came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9lf-16cDJc). Watching only the first minute, it seems to involve a non-black streamer named Hasan who is apparently educated on the nature of racism, and is critiquing Jidion, a black content creator, for his lack of understanding of racism. This might not be an accurate characterization of what's going on, but let's just accept this picture for the sake of my question.

According to standpoint theory, marginalized individuals are in a better position to have knowledge on matters such as racism than non-marginalized individuals since the former have a lived experience with it and the latter do not and are ignorant of it (let me know if this isn't right!).

My questions are this:

1. Does standpoint theory allow for some (e.g. educated by black scholars) non-marginalized individuals to better understand matters such as racism than some marginalized individuals?
2. If it is possible, would it still be problematic for non-marginalized individuals to correct/educate marginalized individuals on matters such as racism?

22,"I saw a question on here about a thought experiment often used to defend abortion and I was reminded of my own take on the matter I thought of a while ago. Forgive me if my train of thought is confusing, it‚Äôs been a while since I wrote a philosophy paper.

- Let us grant that personhood begins at conception, and that ending a pregnancy with the intention of doing so is murder.

- There are other ways of violating someone‚Äôs right to life besides murder. Manslaughter, negligent manslaughter, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, etc.

- Most experts agree that pregnancies end in miscarriage 10 to 20 percent of the time, depending on various factors. This statistic does not include cases in which the fertilized egg fails to implant and is passed unnoticed by the owner of the uterus, which ostensibly happens to a significant amount of pregnancies but is untraceable for obvious reasons.

- Thus, getting pregnant means you are putting a fetus in a situation where they are at a 10 percent risk of dying at the very minimum.

- Putting a person in a situation where 1) there is a significant risk of death and 2) they are unable to consent to it or remove themselves from it constitutes a grave violation of their right to life. Criminal negligence, reckless endangerment, unsure of what specific legal term it would be but it would certainly be prosecutable. For instance, if you made your child play Russian roulette because the guy from Saw offered you a billion dollars to do so, you would be doing something heinously wrong. The only justification for putting someone in such a situation would be to save them from some greater risk to their life.

- A 10 to 20 percent risk of death would qualify as significant to the vast majority of people.

- Therefore, getting pregnant, whether intentionally or unintentionally, ought to be considered a grave violation of the fetus‚Äô right to life, if personhood is granted to begin at conception.

- The fact that it is so clearly absurd and self-defeating for pregnancy to be considered a crime implies that one should not consider personhood to start at conception. 

Possible objections:

- one might argue that there is a moral imperative to keep the human race going. I can see that being the case in extreme circumstances (last person on earth, etc.) but I can‚Äôt see how this would apply to any given individual on a categorical level.


- My argument seems to imply that personhood does not begin at conception but does not directly refute the idea. I suppose one could say that since personhood is an intangible concept, the essence of which cannot be pinpointed, the better way to properly define it is via the implications of competing claims.

Idea (question) Summary: All powerful organizations are inherently evil, you cannot align with a powerfur moral good (on average) because it doesn't exist at scale. This idea assumes good and evil to be real which I know it's debatable.

Detail of my idea.

1. When it comes to power and organizations with the most power (countries, banks, old money families, etc.) - I think they could all be considered ""evil"" - no good guys. Power corrupts humans (the one Ring)

2. Nature directs that power vacuums cannot exist. Meaning, power is always consolidated.

3. There are no ""good guys"", just organizations that seem less corrupt. The division is an illusion.

Except the metalinguistic use (ex. I can say ""fortunately"" is an adverb because of the -ly suffix without knowing what it means), one can think that I need knowledge to use a word. 

And yet, my knowledge can be false or uncomplete: for instance, I can reading and understanding, or writing ""beech"" while I can't recognize this kind of tree on a picture. I know the hyperonym, or category ""tree"", and just it. 

But if I say ""whale"", I can think this is a fish and not a mammal. I can use the word ""whale"" with a false knowledge (even if ""fish"" and ""mammal"" are hyponyms of ""animal"", and the whale shares the characteristic ""lives in water"" with fish). As to proper nous, is it worst: for a character people are not sure they existed, for instance Biblical figures, legendary Royal families, ect, people did not have the acess to extention of these nouns (I vaguely know that proper noun's extentions is a specific problem, do you recommand some readings?)

So my questions are: which quantity of knowledge do I need to use a word? (Correctly, I don't count the mistakes) ? Is knowing the category- even an approximative one, for instance fish or animal for the whale- the minimal quantity of knowledge required to use correctly a word ?

For convenience, I'm defining the term ""effective witchcraft"" as the variety of witchcraft that can cause supernatural events to occur which impact observably reality, including casting spells that work and summoning demons. 

To the best of my knowledge, witchcraft is mentioned negatively in the bible several times and Christians are not permitted to engage in it. At the same time, modern doctrine of the mainstream churches seems to be that effective witchcraft doesn't exist. A brief search on the internet however brings up many search results from smaller Christian groups saying that witchcraft is indeed an effective way of creating supernatural events, although not recommended. Many people appear to have a genuine belief that effective witchcraft is real. If effective witchcraft isn't real, does it make any difference if Christians practice it? I do understand that thought crime is a concept in Christianity and some believe that it can impact the soul. But if they can't actually summon a demon or make a deal with the devil it shouldn't make any difference to the consequences for their soul? 

I assume that most of the anti-witchcraft entries were put in place as a way to stamp out pre-Christian practices.

I understand that scientific enquiry has found zero evidence for readily observable supernatural events. Personally I'm very confident that effective witchcraft is not something that exists in reality. I'm curious if philosophers have been able to rule it out.

124,"This goes back to a really stupid conversation I had with a friend in high school at the start of the '10s. He insisted to me that if we all just agreed that rabbits were pink, they would be pink. I think I basically agree with him to this day. But what do the learned philosophers have to say? What are the conditions that would be required for them to actually be pink? For example:

1. Is it sufficient that, say whenever rabbits are brought up in public discussion, there is nobody ever denies that they are pink when it is suggested? Or does everyone need to provide affirmative agreement that the rabbits are pink?
2. Is it sufficient that rabbits are only affirmed as pink in public discussion? What about in private conversation, whispers in back rooms, that, perhaps, rabbits are actually white, and we did not always think of them as pink? Would they still be pink then?
3. What if in all public and private discussion, rabbits are universally held to be pink - but in the secret hearts of many people out there, there are those who believe that rabbits are not in fact pink, but, indeed, are white - private thoughts, never given voice or recorded anywhere. Would the rabbits still be pink then?
4. Suppose the opposite. Suppose everyone wakes up, and, in our hearts of hearts, believe with firm conviction that rabbits are pink. But it's never brought up anywhere. We never discuss it, never agree upon it. Would the rabbits still be pink if their color were never discussed, privately or publicly, ever again? What if when it were discussed, they were always referred to as white - and yet privately, we all believed they were pink?
5. Are institutions, organization, or systematized knowledge necessary to solidify the agreement that rabbits are pink? In other words, is it sufficient that we all agree they are pink, or do we need systematized bases of knowledge and repositories of truth to acknowledge their pinkness in order to truly make them pink?
6. Finally, do rabbits need to actually hold a quality of ""pinkness"" in order for them to be truly pink? Since a quality of ""pinkness"" is ineffable, or whiteness for that matter, if it were to exist, would it even be relevant to the discussion of whether the rabbit were pink or not?

126,"Recently, I have been reading Peter Sloterdijk's earlier work, particularly the *Critique of Cynical Reason* and *Infinite Mobilization*. Here he seems to position himself in opposition to the ""grand narratives"" of modernity - particularly Kantian transcendentalism and marxist ideology critique. For him, modernity produces philosophies of action that promise ever greater expansion in mobility (e.g., the ""unmasking"" of experience in Kant and the ""unmasking"" of capitalism in Marx). He says, however, that these attempts are in vain: attmeps to rationalize, predict, and plan the world fail. He lays out this position in the opening paragraphs to *Infinite Mobilization*: 

&gt;One idea has rooted itself in pre-modern ways of thinking more deeply than any other: nothing turns out the way it was planned. For even though man may propose, it is still the gods who dispose, whatever the case may be. The a priori of any Old World practical life experience is: if it happens as it should, it happens differently than it was planned. This experience cannot rid itself of the constant awareness that human plans and actions always move in the recesses of an insurmountable passivity. But with the advent of modernity, things happen in a new way ‚Äì just as humans have planned. They do so because people in the West, monks, merchants, physicians, architects, painters, and cannon-makers ‚Äì in summa geniuses and engineers ‚Äì have begun to organize their way of thinking in an entirely new way; and (one would like to say, suddenly) a new kind of ‚Äúpraxis‚Äù joins this reorganization of thought as the technological counterpart of thinking and intervenes in the events of the world with a revolutionary impact. Modernity as a techno-political composite has unhinged the old familiar equilibrium between human power and powerlessness. Spurred on by a history-making amalgam of aggression and optimism, modernity promises us a world in which things turn out as planned because people are able to accomplish what they want ‚Äì and if not, they are able and willing to learn. In modern times, it is the will to power of the can-do spirit that makes the world go around.

My contention is how does Sloterdijk reconcile (or perhaps shift away from) this ""post-modern"" critique of meta-narratives with his later sphereological project? In my brief experience with *Bubbles*, he seems to be building a similarly ""unfashionable"" system of universal history that he finds so repugnant in the Kantian and Marxian projects in his perspective of the 1980s.

Assuming I am not misinterpreting sphereology or the earlier critique of cynical culture, I wonder where he makes this shift, as I do not recall such a discussion in Bubbles (perhaps he deals with this in Globes or Foams though). There is a decade long gap between *Infinite Mobilization* and *Bubbles* so perhaps I am simply missing an intermediary text where he makes a textual break or addition to the critique of meta-narratives?","Sloterdijk, Sphereology and the Position of Meta-Narratives in His Thought",askphilosophy
127,"Apologies for the possibly awkward title, because I'm not quite sure how to ask this question.

A friend and I were having a philosophical chat, and we came to an impasse as to the use of different words versus their concepts and mental representations.

I am of the (intuitive) opinion that the words we use are culturally bound, having a specific intellectual and cultural history, and influence the way we think about the concepts themselves, whereas my friend was (also intuitively I believe) convinced that there are universal mental concepts that exist, that we find words for in every language that reflect that universal meaning.  It almost seemed to me he was arguing for some kind of Platonism in concepts that was universal and cross-cultural, where my stance was that the words and culture that they came from affect the very concepts themselves, making them non-universal, more culturally-relative.

Is that Semiotics, or was there another more specific concept/discipline that expound on these ideas?

I also seem to remember this being discussed on this subreddit a few months ago, but I can't find the post I'm looking for, for the life of me, so I'd like to thank you all in advance for treading once again on a path well-traveled!","What is the philosophical discipline where the ""relativity"" of words between languages and the ideas they transmit are discussed?",askphilosophy
128,"I was just thinking about how philosophy, and a few other academic disciplines, are different than others in that they don‚Äôt often really ‚Äúclose the book‚Äù on a question and just move on. So, for example, in medical sciences there will be times when people just say ‚Äúalright, that drug/treatment didn‚Äôt work. Moving on.‚Äù That‚Äôs not the case for much in philosophy. Even super unpopular and fringe views (the simulation hypothesis, panpsychism, etc.) just go on and on and continue to be written about and continue to branch out into slightly different variations.

So I wonder if this leads to a problem where it just isn‚Äôt practical to be able to arrive at the best conclusions in a non-arbitrary way. It‚Äôs sort of like theology to me, which has the same feature of different lines of thought never really meeting an end. When you choose a theological worldview you have to go down the path of:

Choosing from a large number of religions, then choosing one of the major groups within that religion (ex: Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Coptic) and then choosing particular denominational groups within that (ex: Russian Orthodox Church or Old Believers?) and then choosing various theological viewpoints within that denomination and so forth.

So the end result is that it just looks basically impossible for a person to really set out to rationally establish their theological viewpoint without making arbitrary decisions (ex: I‚Äôm Catholic because I‚Äôm Irish and my grandparents were Catholic, but I‚Äôve never really looked into Taoism to make rational judgements about it). 

Philosophy appears the same, but perhaps to even be a harder thing to really pin your views down in due to the fact that the field is bigger than theology (theology really could be said to be one tiny field within philosophy).

130," Understood in its most vague meaning, this question seems a monumental one. I want to try my best to formulate a few problems which trouble me in order to see what kind of replies I might get to these sub-questions, rather than a general outline of the academic positions on this matter.  


 Firstly, there's an issue with the way knowledge makes use of concepts. Take a proposition like ""the mat is red"". In order for me to possess this knowledge, or maybe even the belief alone, I would have to first be aware of what a mat is, or what red is, or what ""is"" is. Even if my knowledge of concepts doesn't rely on language, at what point in my development did I come to learn what it is that the word ""mat"" or ""red"" denotes? How is such an experience possible to gather from experience? Did I learn what an ""object"" is from experience?  Sure, one can argue that something like ""table"" isn't really a concept, or at least an exhaustive and precise one, since it's just a human construction.  But that just adds extra steps to the problem, namely the problem of finding those concepts which ARE exhaustive and precise, if they exist at all. Still, I don't think saying that every concept is blurry and vague answers the question of how we come to acquire the concept of anything.  The first solution that I can think of is that if a child is exposed to a sufficient number of tables, eventually they will be able to ""induce"" (I'm aware that I use this word vaguely, but I'm not sure what else to call it) what a ""table"" is, if they have people around them to tell them that what they are looking at is a table. But this solution fails to persuade me. Wouldn't it for example necessitate that each one of us has a slightly different concept of tables, or maybe that none of us know what any concept REALLY is, whatever that would mean? 

&amp;#x200B;

  It seems to me that in order for experience to make any sense at all, let alone lead to some form of ""knowledge"" or awareness, there must be some kind of filtering to this experience. Something that any baby has by birth, maybe genetic, maybe not, that allows experience to be grouped and to be comprehended. Otherwise, experience, it seems to me, would just be an unsorted mass of sensations. I'm not even talking about incredibly complex things like the acquisition of language or mathematical concepts like lines and numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

 What in general troubles me is the incredible ability of humans to derive general knowledge from a very small amount of particular data, mentioning not even the need for the general knowledge that is required for the particular data to make sense to individuals.

137,"G. K. Chesterton proposed such a Hegelian
reversal precisely apropos man and animals: instead of
asking what are animals for humans, for our experience,
one should ask what man is for animals-in his less known
Everlasting Man, Chesterton makes a wonderful mental
experiment along these lines, imagining the monster that
man might have seemed at first to the merely natural
animals around him:
The simplest truth about man is that he is a very strange
being; almost in the sense of being a stranger on the earth.
In all sobriety, he has much more of the external
appearance of one bringing alien habits from another land
than of a mere growth of this one. He has an unfair
advantage and an unfair disadvantage. He cannot sleep in
his own skin; he cannot trust his own instincts. He is at
once a creator moving miraculous hands and fingers and a
kind of cripple. He is wrapped in artificial bandages called
clothes; he is propped on artificial crutches called
furniture. His mind has the same doubtful liberties and the
same wild limitations. Alone among the animals, he is
shaken with the beautiful madness called laughter; as if he
had caught sight of some secret in the very shape of the
universe hidden from the universe itself. Alone among the
animals he feels the need of averting his thought from the
root realities of his own bodily being; of hiding them as in
the presence of some higher possibility which creates the
mystery of shame. Whether we praise these things as
natural to man or abuse them as artificial in nature, they
remain in the same sense unique.
This is what Chesterton called ""thinking backwards"": We
have to put ourselves back in time, before the fateful
decisions were made or before the accidents occurred that
generated the state which now seems normal to us, and
the way to do it, to render palpable this open moment of
decision, is to imagine how, at that point, history may have
taken a different turn.

I am a student in Linguistics (I have a Bachelor) and I did two years of philosophy in a ""Classe pr√©pa"" (France), but I have never studied perception (I just heard about ""L'esse est percipi"" once). 

I would like to ask a question about perception and distinctions between shades. Is the conscient distinction of shades (colours, sounds) perception ? (That would mean that perception is subjective). 

I have some examples to specify : 

About the spectrum of colours : perception of colours and their name (the Greeks and the blue and the green, the french word ""orange"" (the colour) which appeared later than the other colour).

About the spectrum of sounds : Some people have the absolute pitch, therefore they are more aware of their perceptions. Some musical systems (I heard about Indian Classical music) make distinctions which don't exist in other musical systems. 

An example for my courses of linguistics (I think that the distinction between phonetics and phonology  is interresting to understand the difference between objectivity (phonetics which studies the sounds themselves) ans subjectivity (phonology : how do the sounds permit to make sense in a given language ? -&gt; phonemes)) : Babies when they are six mounths old can do many distinctions of sounds. Two sounds (kinds of t) are considered as the same in English and different in English. 

I have a question about this fact : is it correct to say the person ""hear"" or not two different sounds (or is it just a metaphor?). 

""Hindi"" babies can do the distinction from 6 month to 1 year but for ""English"" babies, this ability is progressively lost. 

So my questions are : 

1 - Does perception depends on discrete (discr√®tes) categories made on a continuous (continu) spectrum ? (Same things with different numeral system). Is it affected by this process of making categories ? 

2 - If I say, ""Paul does not hear the difference between the C (musical note) and the D"", is it ""philosophically correct ?"" Can one perceive (see, hear...) a distinction ? 

3 - About the example on linguistics, is it an argument to claim that perception is cultural ? And people can adapt their perception (more or less) in terms of culture ?

166,"Ok, so. I have finished going through Spinoza's proof of ""God"", and I feel as though I have missed something fundamental, for it feels like it's a bit...lacking/superfluous?

From what I gathered (and I definitely could be mistaken), Spinoza essentially proves (and I agree with the propositions and logical steps), that everything that *is (*in the ontological sense), is in a way merely a ""facet"" of this substance which is *being itself,* which constantly expresses itself in infinitely different manners (attributes). 

This substance is the only thing that exists, really, fundamentally (we only have an illusion that there are different things, but this illusion stems from the fact that this thing has different, infinitely many attributes (which is what the intellect perceives ), to an infinite extent. And so this thing, is God.

So, Spinoza's God is literally *being.* It is not so much that we and all that exists is in God, for we are not its *constituent* parts, but rather that *God is all*, expressing itself in infinitely different ways (this includes  Time and Space), to an infinite extent. 

But...it feels like he is just using the label ""God"" as a place holder for the property of Being, which is (I think) evidently already necessarily infinite, ""includes"" every thing (for nothing that doesn't exist can be thought or conceived), and takes infinitely different ""forms"". It's just...*beingness* that he seems to have proven exists. 

And I can agree with this idea that we are all this one substance, expressed in different forms (even from a scientific view-point it doesn't make sense to think of any object as entirely separate from the rest of the Universe).

It is a beautiful proof on its own, but why make that leap into using the word God? Especially knowing all the baggage that comes with that word (for he is in no way describing a religious, man-made God that is conscious, all powerful etc, only insofar as Spinoza's God is conscious and powerful because he is literally *everything).* He is not saying ""look God as you understand it is actually this"", he is describing a way to think of reality as a whole, and calling that God. It feels a bit vacuous, for lack of a better word. Or like he is putting two things together which oughtn't be next to each other.

I hope I'm making sense, I'm not sure how I can explain it, except that when I finished going through the proof, I expected to either vehemently disagree, or have a full-on revelation, but I find myself agreeing in a ""well...yeah, that is in fact the case"" way, very unclimactic, which makes me think I maybe missed something.

170,"So from the premise that our current system reduces suffering for some, at the expense of other beings.

Being directly or indirectly responsible for an increase in the suffering of other beings. 

So by beings I think of humans, animals. Maybe in some case even plant life, that might be a different topic/exploration. 

Suffering -  the state of undergoing pain, distress, or hardship. 

I think of suffering as causing (by action, or in certain occasions by omission)  'pain' (mental or physical harm)  to another being.  

Then pain can perhaps be differentiated into different types. (along the lines of maslow's hierarchy of human needs) 

But in the basic sense I think of pain/harm caused by direct violence (assault/murder/war/torture), by environmental pollution/destruction, by exploitation of people and animals (for labor/ or for other means)

(Then there are other pains such as mental/emotional, such as those caused by \[other\] crimes for example)  

\- Agents of change - 

The majority of mass movements to change a status-quo system of oppression have failed, usually by violence or other underhanded methods. Be they passive and non-compliant, or forceful ones.  

Then there is a moral/ethical issue to be explored about human history, nature, morals -  has it ever been ok/justified to 'cause' suffering to other sentient/conscious beings  for the benefit /reduction of suffering of as many beings as possible in the long term/future ?    

&amp;#x200B;

(this type of logic was used to justify and commit great amounts  of suffering to beings in the past, and the present, and inevitibly people with this mindset will also do in the future... ) 

(we can see examples of this used in human/animal experimentation for medicines)   - my personal view is against it, especially for animals as they cant express compliance to it. 

humans it can be more complicated as some 'volunteer'  but in many cases have been ill informed or not disclosed of important informations , ulterior motives .  

&amp;#x200B;

Other types of incidents this logic/thought process has been used in is resistance/revolutions .  where much suffering was caused to both the victim and the ones causing suffering by their acts to resist or change the status quo .   something like the vietnam war comes to mind .  

Is it justifiable or  suffering should be avoided at all cost?   even if it results in other issues such as (subjectively varying levels of undesirable)   oppression, exploitation, or control over freedoms  ? 

if the north vietnamese army simply complied to another nation's colonial/imperialist  rule over them, would they have 'suffered less' because war would have been avoided ?   (personal view is i was against the war of aggression/invasion of vietnam)     but it raises some thoughts and questions of theoretical alternate actions/what if? timelines to be explored  . 

This argument could also be argued against, if we look at the suffering of the peoples of Congo under Belgian rules, who complied with the rulership , but were tortured and abused  by the Belgian rulers, being mutilated and worked to death for resources .  

### [Leopold II of Belgium - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium)

### [Atrocities in the Congo Free State - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocities_in_the_Congo_Free_State)

\[nsfw images  \]

&amp;#x200B;

 Is suffering inevitible whatever humans do ?  Do we need suffering?  Is it part of our essence? Must humans suffer unimaginably short term or even with life long injuries, mental trauma  and 'resist' (in different ways)   to prevent future suffering? 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Agents of change 2 - 

&amp;#x200B;

Now lets explore why we dont change our condition of suffering either of ourselves, or for other beings? 

A very important question .

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do most ppl not join mass movements for change because they are disillusioned of being conned again from previous experiences of fake infiltrated controlled opposition movements?

Will a 'better' system require participation of all/majority to work or is it unethical to force this system even if it reduces max amount of suffering of all beings for our own 'good' (the bitter medicine we dont want to drink, but is a cure for many ailments/social ills)? 

Or because humans have always had a system that forces compliance on all its citizens rather than participation, is it a necessity? necessary 'evil' ?  

Then this would lead into topics of exploration such as how it effects subjective perceptions of reality, 'freedom', tyranny/ dystopia, totalitarianism issues. 

But human society has always had a power structure with some one/some group of decision makers at the top deciding rules/laws for the rest to my knowledge .  so replacing one system with a less suffering/less destructive one?

And how to ensure that the system has the checks and balances to maintain this, and not be subject to the leaderships whims?  also there is a problem of unforseen consequences, where intentions may be good, but due to human error, wrong implementation  or something else we cant predict that may seem good in theory, maybe more suffering will occur to more beings  or by accident/in practise/practical real life application somehow? 

Is our human innate nature inevitably suffering/destructiveness/selfishness/exploitation of others?  

Are most people idealists that hope for a 'better' system but unwilling to sacrifice to achieve it?   Is it because most people are morally good people that dont wish to 'rebel'  or is it because we are easily controlled , by compliance, submissiveness, obedience ,  or is it due to conditioning in systems/institutions set up by the established power hierarchy? or a combination of all? 

So a utopia is not possible, not because of a lack of resources, or human intellect/innovation  but  simply because of human nature?  

as a person of faith, i then also have questions in regard to predestination, fate .  Are we just acting out our parts in a script/play that has already been set?   is it coded in our matrix/dna or souls  ? 

and we just have the illusion or perception of reality of free will ?    when thinking of the size of the universe and our existences, maybe suffering doesnt  matter in the grand scheme of eternity/afterlife/things  beyond human comprehension , that we may have not understood, discovered yet ?  If we assume the 'worldly suffering' of this reality ends after death of  all sentient, conscious beings  .   

Yet it still seems optimal/important to reduce as much suffering as possible of as many conscious, sentient beings.  Even if I am unable to explain why.  

What are your thoughts on these issues? I am interested to hear them.","how to reduce the maximum amount of suffering of conscious, sentient beings?",askphilosophy

204,"Hi! My brother and I were talking about times in our lives when we were the most fulfilled with ourselves, and we both agreed that they overlapped with the times in our lives when we lived in a much humbler manner. For context, we both spent our childhood in an affluent area and had basically everything we wanted growing up.

When I was living with my partner in a very small and only semi-functional apartment, we were actually happier because we only had what we needed and nothing more. We were left with just ourselves. Nowadays, we live in a larger place with many extra comforts, and life for us has become more about taking care of it, and what goes inside it, than what we used to care about. Additionally, now having nicer things instead of shittier things, we become afraid to enjoy them out of fear of damaging something expensive and losing money (appliances, nicer clothes, etc.)

In my brother's experience, the time when he was the most mentally healthy and on-his-feet was during a moving process in which his living situation wasn't really stable, and he was living out of a few bags. Nowadays, he has his own room and a comfortable bed and plenty of comforts like hot water and lots of clothes to wear, yet he almost feels worse about his existence than he did when he was living more frugally, even though he has so many amazing things.

As far as I know, he claims that there are two solutions to a life of suffering. These two solutions are art and resignation. Art can relieve the pain for some time and resignation is more of a long-term solution.

The thing is that I agreed with the fact that art, and specialy music, can releive some of the pain that can come with life, but recently after a breakup, I got into a depression and I tried to apply this solution to my situation. I always listened to music (modern and classical) for many hours a day but after the breakup, even if I tried to, I couldn‚Äôt even listen 1min of any piece of music, or even visit a museum as everything made me overthink too much and worsened my depression so I felt like this wasn‚Äôt helping me at all.

226,"I am working on a philosophical text about Jean Baudrillards concept of hyperreality shown on the episode ""San Junipero"". I am not sure if I understood Baudrillard correctly, this is only my first take and the beginning of getting further into it but I would like to discuss this if anyone is up to it. English isn¬¥t my native language and I used google translate for the translation of the text from my native language, so sorry! I would love to hear other points of views to this!  I want to dive in further into Baudrillards text and develope a concept for explaining it in a very simple way with the episode ""San Junipero"". I want to create a concept for high school philosophy lessons and I am writing about hyperreality and transhumanism on ""San Junipero""!

The simulacra shown on ‚ÄúSan Junipero‚Äù 

They are divided into four orders, imitation, production form the first two orders. ""San Junipero"" imitates the 90s, depicting life at that time. The production goes beyond that, there is no longer a natural reference point here, the city of ""San Junipero"" is fictitious and therefore belongs to the simulacra of the second order. It is a simulacrum that can no longer be interpreted in the classical sense and does not refer to anything that is naturally given but on what is possible through production. This raises the question of how real Yorkie and Kelly are. Is life in ""San Junipero"" just fiction or can we imagine it more like our online games, in which we communicate with each other in a virtual world, but are still real people ourselves. The third order no longer has any reference to reality but can still have real consequences. One such real consequence is the meeting, marriage, and euthanasia of the two women. Here, for the first time, we are confronted with the underlying reference, the reference of the simulacra Yorkie and Kelly, and the recipient notices that this is a reference that refers to something that no longer exists . Furthermore, Kelly and Yorkie are perfected and not a simple copy of their past selves. In the end, with the fourth order of simulacra, representation is gradually replaced by simulation. With the death of Yorkie and Kelly, they no longer exist, they cease to exist in the real world and from there they exist entirely in the simulation.","Baudrillards simulacra on San Junipero, did I get it right?",askphilosophy

228,"I feel like I know the difference but when I try to think more about it, it gets fuzzy.

My background is a computer science. There I would describe generalization as leaving out such details, which once removed, we are left with something which applies to all members of a group. For example, if I describe an animal as a living organism which has eyes and legs, I have a generalization which involves specializations like a human, a horse, a duck, etc... I know that a rock is not an animal, because it is not a living organism with eyes and legs.

What is abstraction them? Because it also involves removing details, but I guess in a different way. I have a hard time to describe it, but I guess I would say that making an abstraction is identifying patterns or principles, and removing everything else. For example, to make an abstraction of a leaf I could draw a black outline in a certain shape and fill it with a green color. But I do not know how would  I make an abstraction of a leaf *in words*.",Difference between abstraction and generalization?,askphilosophy
229,"Or more generally I have trouble understanding what Husserl does in his philosophy. He is like Descartes with his doubt and ""epoche"" but Descartes gets out of skepticism by appeal to God and God's ""perfect honesty"".

230,"Consider the syllogism 

Murder is wrong 

If murder is wrong then you should not murder people 

You should not murder people 

Perhaps,  we can turn the syllogism into a psuedo-syllogism 

This attitude/feeling (x) 

This attitude/feeling (x ) ---&gt;¬† this attitude/feeling (y) 

This attitude/feeling (y) 

...... Another way of putting it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

X occurs 

When X occurs, Y occurs ( simultaneously or not )

Y occurs 

(X, Y don't give any information about the world )


The arrow ---&gt; represents a change or a link in mental cognition with respect to two attitude/feelings. l don't think we should use¬† ""if ... then"" statement as the two attitude/feeling don't have any logical or ordinary causal relation. For instance the link "" ---&gt; "" is not connected in the ordinary meaning of a ball hitting the ground and bouncing off. The attitudes/feelings are related to the firing of neurons or mental states, which can overlap which each other. 

This may help us avoid the frege-geach problem ( I am not sure ). If an attitude/feeling occurs in the brain, we assign T value to it and vice versa. As for the attitude/feeling in themselves, they are non-cognitive, ie they are directed at the world out there and they don't contain information.

235,"I've been reading up on Descartes' argument and his famous statement ""I think, therefore I am"".

So if you think or have thoughts, Rene argues that there is such an entity within which thoughts are being placed by a ""mischievous God"" and hence there exists a ""you"". By this logic, when we have zero thoughts, then it cannot be reasoned without doubt that there is a ""you"" within which the thoughts are placed and hence cannot be sure of your own existence.

I vaguely remember an early modern philosopher (I think it was Leibniz but have not been able to confirm) posited both the existence of God and the Good.

242,"I feel that the inherent nature of moral relativism renders it impossible to prove or disprove. Any objective moral truths seem to be outside of humanity's capacity to ascertain, and any argument trying to perpetuate these moral truths fail simply due to our lack of omniscience. What we value is something we have arbitrarily created; we have decided that it's desirable to live and function within the moral boundaries that we have decided on. If pain and death weren't perceived as undesirable, we would potentially be maximizing the suffering on earth, because that moral system would be just as valid as any other arbitrarily created moral system. A common argument is that this line of thinking would lead to a world in which anyone can do anything they want, no matter how dubious. However, this line of thinking still exists within the already established moral system in which actions like murder are immoral when the system itself has no objective foundation. I suppose my entire argument is that this conversation is limited due to our inability to gain access to moral facts, and thus we have no reason to believe any moral system over another, as they are all arbitrary and propagated by human beings who aren't omniscient.",Are there any valid arguments against moral relativism,askphilosophy

I guess there's the rule utilitarianism view that this would involve considering a (generally speaking) morally wrong action.
