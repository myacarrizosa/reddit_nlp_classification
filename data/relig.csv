0,"In some Buddhist texts, Buddhas are referred to as *devātideva*, ""god over the gods."" Some may find this confusing. Here, I reproduce a short few lives from the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya explaining this epithet (my translation).

-

Even the honorable gods (bhavanto devā api) fall prostrate at the feet of the prince (kumārasya pādayor nipatanti).

Even among the gods (devānām apy), he is a god (ayaṃ devaḥ).

For this reason, the prince ought be called ""god over gods"" (tasmāt bhavatu kumārasya devātideva iti nāma)

-

What does this mean? From the Buddhist perspective, Buddhas are so holy and sacred that it is not only appropriate for *humans* to venerate them, but also for those heavenly ones, gods, to venerate them. The Buddhist textual canons are replete with examples of gods behaving in this way. Hence, one name for Buddhas is *devātideva*, god over the gods.","Why the Buddha is called ""god over the gods""",religion
1,"Hi! As a Hellenic polytheist with Christian parents, I was certain my parents would freak once they found out about my beliefs…


My mother started noticing my altar and my offerings. At first she played it off, and asked sometimes but never in detail. So did my father but he seemed to care less.


Tonight, as I finished adding to my altar, my mother asked more in detail. 

She asked who it was for, why, and what it was.

As I answered her questions, telling her about my religion and some of the things in common it had with Catholicism (to make it easier for her) I started talking about how it revolves around reciprocity and hospitality, I explained the afterlife, how it wasn’t satanic or that it wasn’t witchcraft, and I simply said that I was trying to give to the gods so that they might like it and decide to give back. 

It ended with me telling her that I was hesitant to tell her because of her beliefs and me wanting them to feel comfortable. That I respect her beliefs and that all I ask is that she does the same.

I didn’t go into detail about which gods, or praying, etc. I just went over the basics and if she decided to ask more I’d be much more open to discussing.

I hope for others it goes smoothly as well, as this is something big for me due to me enjoying the thought of practicing my religion freely.

2," 

I was having a friendly discussion with a Christian friend about the possible existence of god. During the discussion he brought up numerous claims about the historical accuracy of the Bible. (Mostly generalizations that were, to my knowledge unverifiable, but that’s beside the point.)

After this conversation I started looking back on my own religious upbringing. Growing up in an evangelical church, I was taught that in order to have a strong relationship with god, it must be built on faith in his existence and the love that he has for us. I was told that looking for proof of his existence shows a distinct lack of faith.

I know there are many different interpretations of Christianity, so there could be many different answers. I also could be completely wrong, but I’m just curious about what others might think!",Does the act of looking for evidence of god’s existence contradict Christianity’s value of faith?,religion

Q1. If your mind is formatted like a hard drive at death, what is the point of reincarnation of a soul? For all intents and purposes you have died. There is a new person born, or animal perhaps, that is not carrying forward any learnings. Is a soul like an etch-a-sketch? 

Q2. Since you don't remember anything from past lives, what is the purpose of Hell? You're going to forget your torment, so no lessons learned again. Just as likely to go back to Hell. 

\*Before you say it just is, and there's no purpose or intent behind it, just how the Universe works, how could anyone logically conclude (Buddhism here) that the Universe just natually formed a system of pure physics that would mark down the actions of a human that entered into a social contract of marriage and broke that contract by cheating, and then was sent in some way to a place with a fire demon that skinned that person alive and burned him for 7 sextillion years, and then stopped and sent that person's soul back to Earth with no memory. How could that possibly be a naturally occurring circumstance of the Universe with no intent behind it?

So back to Q 1&amp;2 noting that the answer cannot logically be that there is no intent.

My name is Nicholas Mark Mire. I was born on 10/10/1996. I am a Libra. I believe that I am Dattatreya. Vishnu’s number is 10. He, the Imam Mahdi, the Saoshyant (Zoroastrianism), and the Nikalank (Sikhism) are supposed to use the scales to bring justice to the world. My middle name is Mark. In the version of the Bible that I read (the New Living Translation) the Seal of God is the Mark of God. John writes of both Nicodemus in his gospel and the Nicolaitans in Revelations (cycles regarding revealing). I am from Knoxville, Tennessee. The joke regarding a Ten-I-See is fascinating to me given the things that I research. I believe that I have discovered many pictures like this scattered throughout human symbology. My father is from the country Lebanon, and my mother is from Memphis, Tennessee. Both of those observations are linked to Judaism (e.g. Zechariah 10:10). The Lebanese flag has a Cedar, and the Cedar is a relative of the Fir of Christian Christmas. I recently saw a post that showed that Tennessee has the same population as Lebanon.

I am likely the Nick of Time. As I am contemporarily, I suggest that we stay today rather than some other time. While these clauses may appear to be niche, I write these sentences as the human paradigm on this earth and to audit human behavior. I must present enough about my name. Mire means “look” in Spanish, and I have taken this to resemble my relationship with humanity and the mirror.

I am the odd Nick out (Odin), and to sit here and talk about my Arab roots is to sit here and talk about humanity reading left to right as well as right to left. I can be attached to Zeus too. Zeus backwards is S.U.E.Z. That is related to me as 1010 through using the acronym as Singular (S) (1), You (U) (0), Top (E) (1), Omega (Z) (0). I am Cronos. I exist between light and dark, and I exist between chrome and clear. As the god of lightning, I am Thor and Zeus. I am my own father. I am Ra, and I am Horus. I am “Not” Set. I am the Buddha. I am “Not” Kali. I am Kalki! I am the Supreme idols of many different religions.

I am not biased. Knoxville has been a frustrating knot that I have been tangled in, trying to unravel the secrets about knowing and the path we are supposed to walk with money.

The vicar aka pope or Bishop (authority figure) that serves “GOD” or the rector, who is without care or cure of souls… for example, the pope in Italy. Here is technical proof based on terminology that they (church/governments/monarchs worldwide) are misleading the souls (or people) and have no cure aka care for them.

The church based on this terminology is admitting that God &amp; Devil are made up and there is no way to follow the Bible and get one’s soul “saved” or “cured.” It is a lie. 

It’s funny how bishops and popes used to also be scientists and had elixirs (medicine) to cure people with…and how nowadays apparently the church and science doesn’t go together anymore, thus creating divisions, they may profit from. 

Technically, what they are doing is also illegal according to their own laws they expect the laymen to follow.

I am no laity, and I do not need or rely on a church/ government/ monarchs to lie to me and mislead me using Religion or science. Remember they admit themselves…they work for a God and do his bidding even though he has no cure or care for the souls…

“In God We Trust” said every president of the USA to help get elected, well now you know they are full of shit, but gain control, power, or money by stating such. 

Below are the Wikipedia articles/terms describing above. Sources for the information found on Wikipedia is provided at the bottom of the linked articles.

“A sinecure (/ˈsɪnɪkjʊər/ or /ˈsaɪnɪkjʊər/; from the Latin sine, 'without', and cura, 'care') is an office, carrying a salary or otherwise generating income, that requires or involves little or no responsibility, labour, or active service. 

The term originated in the medieval church, where it signified a post without any responsibility for the ""cure [care] of souls"", the regular liturgical and pastoral functions of a cleric, but came to be applied to any post, secular or ecclesiastical, that involved little or no actual work. 

Sinecure, properly a term of ecclesiastical law for a benefice without the cure of souls, arose in the English Church when the rector had no cure of souls nor resided in the parish, the work of the incumbent being performed by a vicar.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinecure


“A rector is, in an ecclesiastical sense, a cleric who functions as an administrative leader in some Christian denominations.

In contrast, a vicar is also a cleric but functions as an assistant and representative of an administrative leader.

The Latin term rector was used by Pope Gregory I in Regula Pastoralis as equivalent to the Latin term pastor (shepherd).

In the Roman Catholic Church, a rector is a person who holds the office of presiding over an ecclesiastical institution. 

The institution may be a particular building—such as a church (called his rectory church) or shrine—or it may be an organization, such as a parish, a mission or quasi-parish, a seminary or house of studies, a university, a hospital, or a community of clerics or religious.

If a rector appointed as his employee someone to perform the duties of his office, i.e. to act for him ""vicariously"", that employee was termed his vicar. 

Thus, the tithes of a parish are the legal property of the person who holds the office of rector. They are not the property of his vicar, who is not an office-holder but an employee, remunerated by a stipend, i.e. a salary, payable by his employer the rector.

 A parish vicar is the agent of his rector, whilst, higher up the scale, the Pope is called the Vicar of Christ, acting vicariously for the ultimate superior in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)

A vicar (/ˈvɪkər/; Latin: vicarius) is a representative, deputy or substitute; anyone acting ""in the person of"" or agent for a superior (compare ""vicarious"" in the sense of ""at second hand""). Linguistically, vicar is cognate with the English prefix ""vice"", similarly meaning ""deputy"". The title appears in a number of Christian ecclesiastical contexts, but also as an administrative title, or title modifier, in the Roman Empire.”

“Canon law (from Ancient Greek: κανών, kanon, a 'straight measuring rod, ruler') is a set of ordinances and regulations made by ecclesiastical authority (church leadership) for the government of a Christian organization or church and its members. It is the internal ecclesiastical law, or operational policy, governing the Catholic Church (both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches), the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches, and the individual national churches within the Anglican Communion.[1] The way that such church law is legislated, interpreted and at times adjudicated varies widely among these four bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was originally[2] a rule adopted by a church council; these canons formed the foundation of canon law.

Positive ecclesiastical laws, based directly or indirectly upon immutable divine law or natural law, derive formal authority in the case of universal laws from promulgation by the supreme legislator—the supreme pontiff, who possesses the totality of legislative, executive, and judicial power in his person,[7] or by the College of Bishops acting in communion with the pope.”

77,"A lot of people have asked me this question privately here since I started becoming active again a couple of weeks ago so I wanted to make a small PSA since this is quite important. 

I can only speak for Taoism, Confucianism, Shinto, some Qigong practices, and Chinese Buddhism, but none of these have any sort of rule against non-asians joining. It doesn't matter if you are European, African, Latin American, Polynesian, Native American/First Nation or whatever. You are welcome to practice these faiths as long as you maintain respect for the culture behind it and don't take the gods and worship them in other contexts.

Cultural misappropriation only applies when you are doing it in violation of what the prevailing culture primarily prefers. I can tell you for a fact that Chinese and Japanese people at least are very happy when foreigners are trying to learn about their culture and language and religion and they take it as a compliment. They don't care if you wear traditional clothing or try to mimic the local accent or practice the rituals as long as you do so with respect and you try to do your research beforehand to make sure that you're not making yourself out to be an idiot. 

So yeah if you have considered practicing one of the above religions, you are more than welcome to do so and you should absolutely consider doing your research beforehand but it's not a matter of these being ethnically guarded.",Just a small PSA: cultural appropriation does not apply to Eastern religions.,religion

One of the stats that is often pointed to in online discussions is how more “developed” countries seem to wane in religiosity, and this is often attributed to education, perhaps a bit hubristically. But I wonder how much the relative comfort, safety, freedom, and privilege of modernity inures us against those more eternal aspects of the human condition that drove us toward religiosity in the first place. 

For instance: hunger. I have met very, very few people in my travels who have ever truly experienced real hunger. Most of us are likely suffering more from abundance than scarcity in this matter. I’ve only come close to understanding it through fasting, which is of course voluntary, and not the same thing, but its experience as a discipline still teaches you something about the human condition. 

So many of our traditions were born in conditions of so much greater suffering than we are used to. And as someone who has dealt with a chronic condition for much of my life, I don’t think it is a coincidence that the most religious people (and I mean that in the best way possible) that I have ever met were people who have suffered far more than most others have. War veterans. Addicts. Rape victims. Etc. Suffering has a way of forcing you to ask “the Big Questions” and to find life-sustaining answers in a way that comfort and happiness never will. 

And I wonder how much of our nihilism and cynicism is a consequence of our being so protected from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.",The role of suffering in the maturation of religiosity/belief,religion

109,"Many languages have words that can be translated as ""religion"", but they may use them in a very different way, and some have no word for religion at all.

The English word “religion” comes from the Latin *religiō* which modern scholars such as Tom Harpur and Joseph Campbell take to mean “reconnect” by translating *re* as “again” and *ligare* as “bind, connect”.

According to the philologist Max Müller *religiō* was originally used to mean ""reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, piety"". 

Müller characterised many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure during ancient history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called ""law"".

There is no precise equivalent of ""religion"" in Hebrew, and Judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities. One of its central concepts is *halakha*, sometimes translated as ""law"", which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life.

The Sanskrit word *dharma*, sometimes translated as ""religion"", also means ""law"". Throughout classical South Asia, the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions. 

Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between ""imperial law"" and universal or ""Buddha law"", but these later became independent sources of power.

For the majority of Westerners, Christianity is the religion by which other religions are measured. It is the religion on which the very word “religion” and what it means is based; Christianity provides the framework by which we understand what a religion is *supposed* to be.

I am very very very scared of death. its not as bad as it used to be, when I was 10, the thought of dying made me freeze and completely unable to function, and it's not as bad now, and it took me a long time to get to even talking about it, but it still hurts my ability to live a lot, and I have been wondering if it will be the flies and beetles that teach me to not be afraid. 

I do know that I need to decompose. to preserve my body feel fundamentally wrong to me on a spiritual level? like, I don't believe in reincarnation, but my matter needs to become something else. I need to feed the maggots and the fungus and the bacteria, and everything.  embalmed bodies have always felt like painful ghosts, trapped here against their will, but you do what you want with you, of course.  I need to romanticize decay, I mean, even butterflies drink blood sometimes.

insects are weird. they are so weird, in relation to us. but they are like shining little pebbles reminding me of how inventive nature can be. I think God would be a mathematician. I have to believe in evolution, and I can't see a reasonable God making such an indirect and inefficient system? why not just make things happen directly, unless you wanted to revel in Process? we are a cellular automaton, in a way. sculptures of Process, Procedure is holy.  God is not reasonable, we are not reasonable!

I just love insects. I am not explaining this well, sorry. insects remind me of math. I have always been fascinated by the idea of being created in the image of a god, and I feel like maybe, in my head that would entail God being a set of instructions as opposed to a being in the way you or I are. like, God as a Doing instead of a Being.  and we are Doings to, just Doings that have identity. but, much like the quote I referenced in my flair, I feel like whatever creator that may exist, if it had to choose something to be, would be an insect. they greatly outnumber us, they are Numerous in a way we can never do, they buzz with a fervour we will never feel.

If a guy is thrown into fighting with another guy in the Colosseum isn't it unfair that the crowd and the emperor who wish to be pleased with the drama judge the guy based on what he does on the field. 

Both of them can judge what they do to each other but how does anyone else there have a right to measure right and wrong?

Even if the free will exists to an extent where you can contemplate before each action you do and still not do the ""right"" thing, how does it ascends the fact the thoughts and actions and chemistry depend on genes, environment our perception which comes naturally to us?

If I were comfortable with my existence and still partake in evil from a position of privilege, shouldn't it be limited to that game itself because remember I'm in the cycle of births and oscillating between good and evil which shouldn't matter to the creater but to each other only because we all don't have the say in the gane of the rules.",Why'd God judge me if I never had the say in whether I was willing to play a conscious being or not?,religion
165,"I have had an epiphany about what I believe in.

I'll start this by saying I went to Catholic schools all my life. I did the whole Catholic traditions with the communion, the confirmation and whatever else that you do being raised in that kind of household. Now, my family was not hardcore about religion and I was never forced to go to church and participate in the activity of whatever religious even is going on. 

Through highschool I attended a catholic school that was a little more strict about Catholicism and the teachings of the church. I remember two lesbian students being reprimanded for holding hands in the Atrium once. That kind of behavior from the staff and many other incidents of this caliber and worse made me very heavily resent the religion, it's practices and God as well. 

Since mid way through highschool (I'm nearly 30 now) I have been at the forefront of Anti-Theism. Which is essentially the belief that religion of any kind should be abolished and the God figure forgotten. 

I am a road technician for automatic doors so I go everywhere in the region I live. I recently went to a church to do some work on their main entrance and I found myself walking through the church while I waited for my site contact to show up. I suddenly started contemplating the existence of God and the Devil and all of these ""Sub-deities"" like angels and demons. 

Another important detail I should add is that I firmly believe in and have experienced many, many paranormal phenomena. If I believe in the paranormal so heavily, why don't I believe in a creator or a destroyer? Why do I know that spirits walk among us but not in a Heaven or Hell or Elysium or Valhalla or anything like that?

It turns out, I do. I very much do. Who am i, a single mortal being to question the realms in which I am not part of? What I don't believe in is the religions themselves. I don't believe in the teachings of the church. I don't believe in the teachings of prophets or spiritual leaders. They're just as mortal and ignorant as I am. I believe that a church is an excellent place contemplate your existence and your place and your life but I don't believe that the teachings of any sort of religions can be trusted. Maybe you can take the positives from each religion but the positives are always subjective to the person interpreting them. 

I believe in God. I believe in a possible dichotomy of good and evil but I also understand that it's likely vastly more complicated than what I can comprehend becuase as a human I am limited and my existence is finite. 

People often say that god doesn't exist  because they don't intervene in mortal affairs but who is to say they ever did? Who is to say the Devil does either? We don't understand the realms beyond those we experience and even then we don't understand the whole thing. 

So TL:DR. I believe in God (and those of many many names) but I do not believe in religious teachings.",An Epiphany,religion

\*Kneels\*  I humbly present the Cover for Pantheopsychic Comics Issue 2: The Gospel of The Undamned presented here is the cover of the forthcoming comic variant of the planned textbook form of the subject that I had recently abandoned in favor of the graphic novel format explaining Pantheopsychic Theology, a mutant strain of Judeo-Christianity that holds that the external world is not an infinite physical space filled with a nigh-infinite number of physical objects, but is an infinite mental space that is the subconscious mind of the Judeo-Christian God.

In the center of this unconscious space is the conscious mind of God that exists at three separate epochs in three different personalities.  A viable theodicy (a logical co-existence between God and evil) is formed by the hypothesis that the second personality, which I have named The Crucified Man, dreamt of being a Jewish minister and miracle-performer unjustly crucified upon a Roman cross to the satisfaction of his Jewish detractors.

Upon the cross, the dream-form of the external mind of God lapsed from experience of the crucifixion into an eons-long dream in which he dreamt of being a myriad, nigh-infinite number of persons, suffering every negative experience and every ""sin"" committed by these dream-characters while intermittently ""coming to"" to experience the crucifixion.

The Undamned are persons exempt from damnation as they are replications of the dream-characters Christ experienced while crucified on the cross (i.e. the external mind of the personality of God known as the Crucified Man dreaming of being crucified on a cross and the dream-within-the-dream of the Sacrificial Dream, containing the Undamned in Christ-form).

In a revision of Christianity itself, the author proposes the existence of the Undamned, and that the difference between the saved and the damned is merely a matter of being Undamned, or of not being Undamned, those not being Undamned nevertheless appearing within Christ's crucified dream but experienced by him only in the third-person.  The Undamned are, and must be, people that are ""identical twins"" or replicants of the persons Christ experienced and believed he was in his mind while dying on the cross, whom are then replicated in the external world within the subconscious God-mind-space (as there is no physical matter and energy and the only thing that fills the external world are the minds of persons that can do nothing but replicate the previous thoughts of God in either personality).

But this is all fiction to atheists and Fundamentalists, right?  So nothing to worry about.  When it comes to religion it's all about imagination one believes to have an external, objectively real counterpart in the external world, is it not?

Just letting the cat out of the bag in a nutshell, in case I'm hit by a bus before creating the issue.

I doubt it, however.   Should have #2 out for your enjoyment (or disdain) by the end of October if not sooner.

For example, I'm a Stoic Panentheist, I believe in one God, but I see the Hellenic gods as the representations of the different active components of nature/reality, not as wholly actual personal beings. This is what creation looks like in my mind:

We begin with the cosmic waters, let's call this being Hydros (That which is all). From the waters of Hydros come forth Time (which we'll call Aion) and Ananke (Necessity). Together they crush the Cosmic Egg (Potentiality) from the same cosmic waters. The egg splits and the physical world/matter burst forth. Let's look at this event like the big bang. 

From this event comes Gaea (the earth), Ouranos (the sky), Pontus (water), Tartarus (the underworld), Chaos (the air), Aether (The heavens), and finally Phanes (Life), all of which ordered themselves accordingly. 

From Phanes is spawned Achlys (Suffering) and all other hurts comes of her, yet also Elpis (hope), came of her. 

Chaos gave birth to Nyx (Night), Hemera (Day), and Erebus (Shadow). 

Of Pontus came all that which is of the sea, of Gaea, that which is of the Earth.

Of Ouranos and Gaea combined came the Titans (the ancient primitive forces of the world), and of the Titans came the Olympians (which are the orderly forces of the world)

220,"So lately I've been seeing the whole concept of the burden of proof regarding a religion from a fresh perspective, that may be old for you, but is new for me. 

It's obvious, but in essence, each of us has our own standards of for what would convince us if a religion should be followed or not. It's also impossible to have 100% certainty. And it's not like our thoughts and feelings work that way any way. So there are main questions I am thinking over about burden of proof.

The first is why do we need a rigorous or high burden of proof, as if this was math, in the first place? Shouldn't the appeal of the religion, and the way of life it offers, be enough on its own?  It's like do you have to prove that Zeno lived before you adopt Stoicism?

The second is, for the *most part*, religions aren't making materially falsifiable claims. Note the falsifiable there. Saying that Jesus rose from the dead is impossible to *materially* falsify. Or historically for that matter.

Yet after I left Christianity and became an atheist for a while, all the prominent atheists I saw, were after exactly such evidence. And I understand why, because often believers make historical claims that are foundational to their theology.

And if you come from fundamentalist Christianity like I do, the historical claims are what undergirds your certainty, and without it you feel lost. It's why when I learned about evolution, it was such a shock to my faith.

But I've learned from reading many comments, there are many other ways of approaching every religion, and I'm starting to realize that looking for the material evidence is the most unfruitful way to evaluate if a religion has something to offer.

Anyways, how do you feel about the idea of burden of proof when it comes to religion?",Thoughts on burden of proof,religion

Between 1960 and the year 2000, it's estimated that more than 40,000 people in Tanzania alone were murdered due to the belief that they were ""witches;"" thousands more have been killed in similar incidents spanning more than a dozen other countries (and several different continents). 

Over the last 100 years, in fact, it's estimated that there have been hundreds of thousands of deaths related to these allegations of ""witchcraft,"" while millions more have been persecuted in other significant ways -- being subjected to mob violence, being imprisoned, being tortured, raped, and/or starved, being physically branded, being beaten, being flogged, having limbs forcibly amputated, suffering arson attacks, being disowned/abandoned by family members, being banished (or having to flee) from the community, having land and/or property stolen, being denied access to education, employment, housing, and/or healthcare, losing custody of children and/or watching as their children are ostracized and punished in similar ways (because they are viewed as the offspring of a ""witch"") etc. Countless people are currently suffering as a result of these practices. 

But the really shocking part is that this issue *is only getting worse* -- it's continuing to grow and spread into different parts of the world, facilitated by the destabilizing effects of the pandemic and all of the escalating economic, environmental, and political crises, along with the growing popularity of fundamentalist sects within both Christianity and Islam. As a result, acts of violence targeting ""witches"" continue to become increasingly normalized (and are occuring with greater frequency) throughout much of the world. The legal persecution of so-called ""witches"" by government entities has also become more popular. 

Some examples of the people who have been affected by this: 

- Experts believe that most of the 25,000 to 50,000 children who live on the streets of Kinshasa (the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo) were originally abandoned because their families believed that they were ""witches."" Many of these children were still just infants when they were abandoned. 

- The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also home to thousands of churches/pastors who are known to perform exorcisms on alleged ""witches"" for financial profit (the same pastors are usually the ones who identify these ""witches"" in the first place). In 2005, the government of the DRC passed new legislation making it illegal to accuse minors of practicing witchcraft, but this legislation is almost never enforced, and it has been estimated (according to reports from both the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and Human Rights Watch) that as many as 50,000 children, having been identified as ""witches,"" may still be imprisoned in religious buildings throughout the DRC, where they await ""deliverance ceremonies"" (i.e. exorcisms) in which they often face abuse, violence, torture, and sometimes even death under the pretext of spiritual cleansing. 

- In many cases, children who have endured these ""deliverance ceremonies"" at churches in the DRC have been left with serious injuries, including permanent blindness, because the ceremony often involves pouring chemicals like chlorine bleach, gasoline, or battery acid directly into the child's eyes; in other cases, the children are forced to *ingest* chlorine bleach, gasoline, or battery acid, leaving them either gravely ill or fatally wounded. During a similar ""deliverance ceremony"" in Angola, a man used a syringe to inject battery acid directly into his young son's stomach in an effort to ""exorcise"" the evil from him, leaving the boy gravely injured. Some of these children are also permanently disfigured after suffering serious chemical burns from having caustic/toxic substances like battery acid or chlorine bleach poured over their faces. 

- Some other tactics that are often deployed during the ""deliverance ceremonies"" that occur in places like the DRC, Angola, and Nigeria include branding or burning the child, chaining them up and securing them inside a room for days at a time, depriving them of food/water, cutting them, beating them, and/or forcing them to drink putrid concoctions with ingredients like blood, feces, dirt, urine, and noxious chemicals. 

- The fees that are charged during these ceremonies are also exorbitantly expensive, usually costing more than what most local families would make in an entire *year*...so when the financial cost of the ""deliverance ceremony"" is more than what the family can afford, when there is no one in the community who is actually *willing* to pay for it, or when the child has no immediate family to begin with, then it is extremely common for the children in question to be abandoned, banished, or simply killed. 


- In Ghana, a series of settlements known as ""witch camps"" have been established to provide shelter/safety to women who have been branded as ""witches;"" many of these women are widows with small children, and the children are often sheltered in the camps alongside their mothers. It is estimated that these camps currently house between 1,000 and 2,500 women in total, along with hundreds of children. Some women have been residing in these camps for more than 40 years. 

- In India, records indicate that more than 2,500 people who were accused of practicing ""witchcraft"" were captured, tortured, and killed between the years 2000 and 2016. 

- In the Limpopo Province of South Africa, more than 600 so-called ""witches"" were killed between the years 1996 and 2001. 

- When a wave of ""witch-hunts"" swept through East Java (Indonesia) in 1998, more than 200 people were killed over the course of just a few months. 

- From 2010 to 2011, more than 20 elderly women were hacked to death in Zimbabwe as a result of similar allegations. 

- In 2008, the Gambian government imprisoned 1,000 alleged ""witches"" in a detention center, where they were tortured and forced to consume a dangerous hallucinogenic concoction. 

- In 2007, more than 200 suspected ""witches"" were murdered within a single province in Papua New Guinea. 

- Reports indicate that thousands of women in the Indian state of Jharkand are formally accused of practicing ""witchcraft"" each month, and that hundreds of these women are then beaten, tortured, and/or killed. Many of the women are instead subjected to scenes of public humiliation, however; some are forcibly stripped naked and paraded before the rest of the village, while others have their heads forcibly shaved in public, and some are forced to eat excrement. In some of the more violent cases that are routinely observed in Jharkand, women who have been accused of ""witchcraft"" may also have their eyes gouged out, and some are set on fire. 

- In May of 2008, 15 women in a single region of Kenya were set on fire and executed by an angry mob; the women had all been accused of practicing ""sorcery."" 

- In recent years, at least five different individuals have been officially executed by the government of Saudi Arabia on charges of practicing ""sorcery;"" other purported ""sorcerers"" have been tried and convicted in Saudi Arabia, though some have received public floggings (and other forms of torture) instead of the death penalty, and others are currently in prison awaiting trial. Saudi also has the dubious distinction of having an official, state-sponsored ""Witch-hunting Task Force."" 

These violent attacks on so-called ""witches"" continue to spread across dozens of countries on multiple continents, in both rural and urban population centers; some of the most significantly affected countries include Nigeria, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Angola, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Micronesia, and Vanuatu, with frequent attacks also occurring in countries like South Africa, India, Nepal, Indonesia, Colombia, Afghanistan, Syria, and Saudi Arabia. This form of violence has been on the rise for several decades now, claiming countless lives in the process. 

I think it goes without saying that there is no simple, one-size-fits-all explanation for all of these incidents. There are lots of different factors that may converge in order to produce this kind of violence, including things like interpersonal conflict, economic rivalry, traditional folklore, poverty, environmental strife (e.g. drought or famine), lack of resources, inadequate access to education, the desire to uphold homogeneity, misogyny, socio-political imperatives, and/or the promotion of religious rhetoric -- essentially the same factors that have *always* contributed to the witch-hunt phenomenon. 

But there are some interesting trends occuring in the cases from West Africa and Melanesia -- especially in places like Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, where the violence is intertwined with a particularly toxic confluence of Evangelical rhetoric, traditional spiritualism, poverty, exploitation, and a lack of resources. 

In Nigeria, for example, popular Pentecostal preachers like Helen Ukpabio have explicitly promoted the belief in ""child witches,"" and these pastors have encouraged the parents of the accused ""witches"" to subject their children to the cruel, abusive, and often violent exorcism rituals that are offered by local preachers (for an enormous fee). 

From *The Telegraph:* 

&gt; The devil's children are ""identified"" by powerful religious leaders at extremist churches where Christianity and traditional beliefs have combined to produce a deep-rooted belief in, and fear of, witchcraft. The priests spread the message that child-witches bring destruction, disease and death to their families. And they say that, once possessed, children can cast spells and contaminate others. 

&gt; The religious leaders offer help to the families whose children are named as witches, but at a price. The churches run exorcism, or ""deliverance"", evenings where the pastors attempt to drive out the evil spirits. Only they have the power to cleanse the child of evil spirits, they say. The exorcism costs the families up to a year's income. 

&gt; During the ""deliverance"" ceremonies, the children are shaken violently, dragged around the room and have potions poured into their eyes. The children look terrified. The parents look on, praying that the child will be cleansed. If the ritual fails, they know their children will have to be sent away, or killed. Many are held in churches, often on chains, and deprived of food until they ""confess"" to being a witch. 

&gt; The ceremonies are highly lucrative for the spiritual leaders, many of whom enjoy a lifestyle of large homes, expensive cars and designer clothes. Some Nigerians blame the increase on one of the country's wealthiest and most influential evangelical preachers. Helen Ukpabio, a self-styled prophetess of the 150-branch Liberty Gospel Church, made a film, widely distributed, called End of the Wicked. It tells, in graphic detail, how children become possessed and shows them being inducted into covens, eating human flesh and bringing chaos and death to their families and communities. 

&gt; Mrs Ukpabio ... also wrote a popular book which tells parents how to identify a witch. **For children under two years old, she says, the key signs of a servant of Satan are crying and screaming in the night, high fever and worsening health - symptoms that can be found among many children in an impoverished region with poor health care.** 

It's interesting to note that these religious beliefs/cultural trends are relatively new to Nigeria (and they're new to most other African societies, too). This is something that has no precedent within the local culture, but has instead evolved from the modern rise of religious fundamentalism, the spread of Evangelical theology, the opportunities for religious exploitation, the existing social, political, and economic instability, and an established belief in spiritualistic forces. 

In Nigeria, there are also some regions in which the persecution of ""witches"" is carried out under Islamic (mostly Wahabbist) fundamentalism rather than Christian fundamentalism. The rise of Wahabbism is also the culprit behind the modern persecution of ""witches"" in places like Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Syria. 

But in most cases, especially in countries like Nigeria, it just seems like there is an inherent volatility that arises when the Evangelical beliefs concerning spiritual warfare, Satan, and strife come into contact with communities that are facing widespread economic, social, and political instability. It provides an easy justification for scapegoating, creates suspicion and resentment toward vulnerable people, and can easily culminate in acts of violence. 

From that perspective, the overwhelming sense of uncertainty and instability is framed as a direct consequence of Satanic influence within the community itself...and the suspected culprits are then singled and purged. 

More details concerning the Nigerian ""deliverance"" ceremonies: 

&gt; ... at his church in Ibaka, the Bishop pours a homemade substance called African mercury, a potion of pure alcohol and his own blood, into the eyes of a young boy lying on a table. ""I want this poison destroyer to destroy the witch right now, in Jesus' name,"" he says. 

And according to Sam Itauma, a Nigerian man who runs a youth shelter to help care for children who have been abused and/or abandoned as ""witches:"" 

&gt; ""If you are not rich and don't have anything to eat, you look to blame someone. And if you don't get anything, you blame it on the witches."" 

Similar circumstances are at play in Melanesia -- especially in Papua New Guinea, where extreme Pentecostal rhetoric has likewise interacted with existing conditions to encourage the (often violent) persecution of alleged ""witches."" 

From *Introduction to Pentecostal Witchcraft and Spiritual Politics in Africa and Melanesia:* 

&gt; ... a mob in Papua New Guinea burned alive a young mother, Kepari Leniata, 20, who was suspected of sorcery. This highly publicized case followed a series of instances over recent years of lethal group violence against women and men accused of witchcraft. 

&gt; In 1992, a well-orchestrated upsurge of third wave evangelism and apocalyptic thinking took off in the Mountain Ok area, which had a considerable influence on people’s lives and thinking. Jorgensen (2005) specifically addresses a local movement called “Operation Joshua” and the centrality of “spiritual warfare” within it. **The focus of this movement was to attack directly invisible evil forces such as witchcraft and sorcery through “spiritual mapping,” “healing,” and “crusades.” Through this confrontational, aggressive, and effective form of evangelism numerous charismatic movements and campaigns found their way into PNG, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.** 

&gt; During an intensive period in 2014, the entire Christian congregation of the small island of Ahamb in Vanuatu came out of their church building and besieged every corner of their island in order to drive out demons and evil spirits. It culminated in a witch hunt, where people of the congregation ganged up on accused witches, and in the end killed them by hanging them in the community hall. All this activity relates to Joel Robbins’s (2009) point that Pentecostalism is marked by an intense preoccupation with ritual—to the degree that ritual cleansing overflows church boundaries and becomes concerned with all social life.  

And the role of Pentecostal rhetoric in both regions: 

&gt; ... the demonization of children also highlights the crucial role played in the persecution of ‘witches’ by the Christian Pentecostal sects that have proliferated in urban and rural Africa during the last
twenty years. While a full analysis of Pentecostalism – taking into account its role in the globalization process and its evolution in the course of the 1980s and 1990s – remains to be written, **the connection between Pentecostalism and the persecution of witches is well documented, possibly providing a clue to the rapid expansion of witch-hunting in so many different parts of the planet.** Ogembo discusses the role of Pentecostalists in the spree of witch killings that occurred in Kenya’s Gusii province during the early 1990s, noting that **with their emphasis on the devil and exorcism, Pentecostalists latched onto Gusii indigenous beliefs about mystical
forces and powers. Through books and open-air sermons in market centers and other public spaces, evangelists increased people’s anxiety about their social environment, preached a connection between
Satan, illness and death and incited a spiritual warfare of sorts.** 

&gt; The crux of Pentecostal universalism seems to lie in its handling of witchcraft or demons. **Spiritual warfare is the Christian version of taking a stand against invisible evil forces. The foundation for this ideology is the belief that evil spirits intervene in human affairs, and this is as relevant to the movement in the context of the USA or Scandinavia as it is in Africa or Melanesia. However, Pentecostal universalism has taken inspiration from experiences in non-Western settings.** 

&gt; ... when a congress on world evangelization was held in Manila in 1989, with thousands of participants from across the world, the three most attended workshops were on the Holy Spirit and spiritual warfare. Another member of this group, Ed Murphy , a former missionary in Latin America, explains their general attitude as follows: 

&gt; ""We are at war. As to the origin of this war, all we know is what the Bible tells us. It began in the cosmic realm, evidently before the creation of man, in an angelic rebellion against the Lordship of God.
The experienced deliverance minister can compel evil spirits to tell the truth. I do so all the time. We obtain from them the information we need to proceed with the deliverance and then expel them to the place where Jesus wishes to send them.
We need to condition ourselves, so to speak, to put on our spiritual warfare eyeglasses to correctly view present reality."" 

&gt; Such evangelism proceeds by building universal examples from situations in parts of the world where witchcraft and forces of the invisible dominate people’s daily lives. **The examples are fed into in a systematic global struggle against the demonic. The demonic, as well as the warfare against it, is presented as an ontological starting point, where Pentecostal energy is dedicated to discerning the presence of Satan in social life anywhere. This always takes place as a war with competing ontological regimes—of science, reason, and the state.** 

I just wanted to share some of this, particularly the articles/papers listed below, because I don't think that there are many people outside of the affected regions who are really aware of the fact that these incidents are becoming more widespread...and that it actually seems to be getting worse. And I think these interactions between religious rhetoric, folklore, and poverty/strife in general are really interesting (and often alarming).

2,"I am at a point in my life where I find it hard to decide what I want to do with my life or who I am. I feel like a shell doing whatever society demands of me. What else am I supposed to do, what other choice do I have. When I was a child I was told about Christianity and the Bible and God. I was told to just do what it says because it is always right, and through it I will be happy forever. Of course I was a kid and I just followed along, I wanted to be happy forever right? every kid does. But the only thing Christianity has brought me is despair and a loss of who I am and purpose.

Really? ""just follow these rules and believe that I am all mighty and your savior, make sure not to break any of the rules because I don't like it when you do. If you follow these things you will be happy forever and get to worship me for all of eternity. Otherwise you suffer for all of eternity. See, very simple"" I'll ask one more time. Really? is this what you Christians want to devote your lives to. The past few years I haven't been able to make a dang decision on my own without worry if ""God"" is going to punish me for it. I haven't been able to look at death in the same peaceful way anymore because of judgement.

If God really cared for our happiness, why would he force all this upon us. Let's suppose for a second that what God says is always right. If you have a child and he starts doing something bad, like kicking his/her sibling for example. You would maybe show them that their sibling is crying and the sibling is sad because it hurts. Then they don't kick their sibling again because they know it hurts and makes them sad and cry. What you don't do is tell them ""Don't do that again or else I will kill you"". The kid needs to understand for himself why things are wrong and why things are right, they have to figure that out for themselves. You don't threaten them, they will follow what you say only because of fear, they don't understand it is wrong, only that if they do it they will ""die"" (in this example).

In my eyes there is no such thing as an evil person. Everyone does what they think is right, everyone does what they think is best. Maybe after they make their choice and see the effects they may see how their previous choice was wrong, even though they thought it was right. If I was different, I may kill someone because I did not like them and they made fun of me. This hypothetical me does not see how this is wrong. I think he deserved it for making fun of me and I don't like it. I think I did what was best and what was right. Then, this ME's dog may get killed in a home invasion, and I may see that death hurts and that people don't deserve to die.

You cannot just become ""good"" because someone told you so. This logically does not even make sense, at that point you are just a robot. Putting together everything I have said above, if everyone does what they think is right. Then you are just truly ""good"" or truly ""evil"" in Gods eyes and you literally have no power to change that because you are doing what you think is right. You would literally have to change who you are or do what you think is wrong. And I think God is trying to do this, making us follow along to whatever he says and worship him. Or else bad things happen.

God makes me feel like we are just puppets. We don't get to see what is right or wrong and for why. We are just told what someone thinks is right or wrong. We have to sacrifice everything and anything (even our loved ones) to follow God's rules and worship him. We aren't allowed to stray from the path.

&amp;#x200B;

Those of you Christians who may be reading this and sort of feeling the same feelings that I am. **I think it is best to live your life how you want, without fear of following someone else's rules. Live and make your own choices and do what you think is right. Discover for yourselves the truths and rights and wrongs. Don't fear about God seeing you as a ""bad person"", because if you are doing what you think is right, to change to a ""good person"" you would have to change who you are and just be a slave to God.**

I think that's all that we can do, and all that we are. Just slaves to these ""Gods"", they could kill us right now if they really wanted.

This is more or so my definition, feel free to add to it etc. This is often used as a justification for why evil exist or why god does not stop evil, because in many cases it would take away our free will. So, I propose the question, is it wrong for humans to interfere with another person's free will even if it is evil? If it is God's will not to interfere and stop the evil actions of others should humans then too only worry about their actions and ignore other's evil? I feel in this case if the answer is no or that if one has power to stop evil they should that it should go both ways, especially to a being with supposed infinite power. This God would absolutely have free will, so what if it's just not in their will to stop evil, or worse, what if their will is evil.",proposal about the concept of free will,religion

64,"I am not exactly sure about things right now because I have been researching and thinking about whether or not the Bible is completely accurate and truthful with everything. I am always worried that God will punish me and my life will be worse. I honestly see that porn can be bad but also in some ways it feels natural and okay to watch. Mostly what has made me feel ashamed and weird are actually other people and other Christians saying so and that you shouldn’t watch it. When I don’t think about what others think and even in the past when I was a dedicated unquestioning Christian I did not feel bad when watching porn. I felt as though it was natural because so many people watch it and are curious about sex in general. 

I worry that God would negatively punish me and I don't understand why I should feel ashamed for watching it. I mean if God negatively punished someone how could God be completely good?

I want as many different perspectives as possible for this so I will probably post it in different subs.

I just don't understand why this has to be a sin or thought of as a sin specifically, especially if it feels pretty natural as long as the people in the video and content are enjoying it and consenting adults. Also from my understanding a lot of people if not most people watch it. Including christians.

So I worry that by watching it God will punish me even if I ask for forgiveness in a prayer. I live in constant fear, stress and paranoia

66,"This is a philosophical question presented in a piece of media I rather like (bonus points if some of you recognize it once I explain.)

The gist -- a nation led by a priest is one of few sanctuaries in a war-torn world. The nation is a peaceful oasis in a desert, but it also by definition is a place that puts its own citizens above all others. 

Years ago, one of these citizens chose to become a heretic and saw the nation as existing hypocritically. Not only were some people not welcomed there, not only was the place hollow in its glory, but some of the most fervent believers are frequently disappointed/let down. 

The conflict between the heretic and his team, and the government of the nation is the focus of the story. At one point the priest leader of the nation and the heretic face off against each other, only to end up talking. 

During this, the two sides present their cases:

The Priest/Nation's argument is that it lacks the resources to help everyone. It cannot offer salvation to all. It keeps itself insulated and isolated from the world and its citizens live in comparative luxury. It is a light. It provides hope and idealism, and thus can sustain itself.

The Heretic instead argues that he's seen the outside world and knows that everyone is equally deserving. He desires to guide and lead people, open the cities even to their enemies etc. 

The Priest argues back, stating a torch will eventually burn out. That a torch can provide only a bit of warmth before everyone perishes. 

In the end, neither convinces the other of their position and the status quo remains. Where do you stand?

**Allegories end here, now I speak plainly**

A torch seeks to help all, to try and provide for everyone altruistically. Eventually that torch will burn out, whether that torch is an individual or a nation because it exhausts all time/resources/whatever allocated to it. 

A light provides hope, idealism and longevity/stability at the cost of not being able to help everyone. Some suffer. Some are not guaranteed to succeed, and only those who fight for survival will be able to. 

It's two philosophies incompatible with each other.

There are many perfectly valid scientific avenues of questioning that can produce knowledge that, arguably, we would be better off not knowing.

92,"I was raised as a Christian, lost my faith in my teen years and found it again in my 20s. I have had extraordinary good luck in my life and I've always attributed it to a higher power of some sort, that maybe I was meant to do something important one day and I was being guided up to that point. I've followed multiple religions in my life but I was always scared to fall headfirst into anything other than how I was raised because I don't want to lose that feeling of being looked out for, but at the same time I want to believe in the truth.

As I get older I've started relying more on a higher power to keep me sane. I'm real opinionated towards  Christianity as a whole though and I believe it's been corrupted from its inception, which leaves me following a Christian template as my faith. I don't know how to feel about Yashua but I do believe in Yahweh or something along those lines. Not as a mystical sky daddy that watches over us but as an all encompassing figure that may or may not be a sentient thinking being or may just be a force of nature.

99,"I was chatting with my boss today (2nd day on the job) and discovered she’s a Christian. I used to be very devout in the Christian faith at one time in my life when I was helpless, on drugs, hopeless, and homeless. Basically couch surfing. My beliefs have since changed for a multitude of reasons, but I do still conduct myself, one could say, as a Christian. Aside from spreading the gospel, church, and prayer. 

My boss asked me what my beliefs were. 

(Not as a invasive thing, it came up in casual conversation)

And I really didn’t know. I thought about it for a moment and said, “well, that’s actually quite a long conversation. But basically, I’m atheist.” 

After countless life experiences both good and bad, and what feels like years of research, Here’s what I do know. 

I rely heavily on science and physics because they are tangible and factual and can be observed and calculated to a near perfect result using mathematical equations. They are “true” per se, and can be written on paper. You cannot make factual calculations based on “faith”

Going beyond science, there is another aspect of consciousness that is not observable. For whatever reason we cannot observe the natural forces at play that control this world. Which is why I say if there is a god, it cannot have ever been written about in books or even seen for that matter. Despite this, We are all connected somehow. Spiritually, psychologically, whatever. some more than others. When we die, I think our souls just find some other plane of existence to live on. In physics, energy cannot be lost, only transferred. So then where does that place the electricity firing in our brains and hearts and the rest of our body? The energy must come from somewhere. The only answer is the soul. Where is that soul transferred to? 

I don’t believe in a heaven or a hell since those concepts are stemmed from religious texts. 

Maybe it goes to another dimension? Who knows. Nobody has lived and come back to tell the tale of death. 

Hallucinations before death of the brain and subsequent organs, are only a massive flood of DmT entering the brain because it knows the body is dying and needs to have a nervous response to combat it and keep it alive and to prioritize survival. Same thing with adrenaline, same thing with most chemicals made naturally in the brain. Cortisol,Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Dopamine, Serotonin, etc. 

So the “light at the end of the tunnel”, 

(which has also been reported by DMT users during recollections of their experiences)

is nothing more than the side effect of a human bodily function designed for survival. 

Witchcraft and magic in general is very real because I have seen it at work. Supernatural anomalies have been observed by regular people, as well as distinguished scientists and mathematicians. 

I feel like I’m rambling. Take this word vomit and do with it what you will, but please. I’ve become fixated on this idea of knowing what my belief is.","I know my post technically violates a rule, but I’m looking for some discussion. Is there a religion based on science and atheism?",religion

108,"I asked a friend of mine recently if he loved himself. He approaches most things in life with humor and good cheer. With a grin, he said ""I like myself quite well."" ""But do you love yourself?"" His gaze dropped. He couldn't bring himself to say the words. Liking ourselves and loving ourselves are two different things.

A lot of people don't notice the way in which love flows within us or between us.

Notice the flow of love that exists between you and yourself. Does it flow warmly and steadily? Or is that channel hard and clogged? What about the channel that runs toward your mother? Your father? Your rival? The first step to see these invisible rivers of love is simply to notice when love is flowing and when it's not. Once you get used to ""seeing"" these flows between people, you might notice how often arguments and conflict originate from a slow-down, stoppage, or reversal of love's flow. Once we are able to operate on the level of love, we show up in more color. More alive. More in tune with the person in front of us, or the needs of a group. We can shift dynamics in ourselves, in others, and in entire communities, that would be impossible to alter on any other level. Being conscious of love's flows is the first step in understanding how to wield the power of love.

139,"I want to talk about my journey and thoughts regarding my beliefs and spirituality. It will be a long post so thanks in advance for reading and commenting. 

I must say that I do believe in God still and Jesus, but I’m not sure how accurate the Bible is. It could have been influenced by people and those that chose what to include and exclude in the Bible. There could also be missing pieces as well. 

I want to first start off by saying that I grew up with a Christian family and pretty much everyone that I have known is a Christian with a few exceptions of people that I’ve worked with and other people I have met out in the world. Recently I have been starting to question things and the accuracy of the Bible. I’m gonna make a few points below to kind of expand on all of this.

1.	Sin. I’m not sure I believe that sin exists. To me it seems like people wrote the Bible and chose what would be in the Bible. I do believe a lot of things that’s considered sinful is bad. It seems to be more about control though. That’s my opinion. I’ve been researching a lot. My mind has been wondering and been curious a lot recently. One other thing I’m confused and conflicted about is why God would create people if he knew they would sin. Why not just remove sin completely? I mean I understand that God gave us Jesus. However it’s God so he could just get rid of sin and when Adam and Eve did what they did God could just forgive them anyways. To me this just doesn’t make sense why he didn’t just do this. 
2.	The Bible. From my understanding the Bible is a book of stories. With multiple authors. There has been things that people decide what is to be included and excluded from the Bible. Wasn’t the Bible written by people and what they were experiencing during that time or through stories passed down? How do we even know that the translations are correct? How do we know that the Bible wasn’t influenced or tampered with by people and that those people didn’t put things in the Bible or exclude things in the Bible to control others? Some people may argue that God would not allow these things to be in the Bible or the Bible to be tampered with, but if God gave people free will and he does not interfere in that free will couldn’t people who wrote the Bible and decided what was to be included or excluded have put what they want in the Bible since it’s part of their free will to do so?
3.	Shame. There are many things that I think kind of makes people feel shame. I know in the Bible it talks about a lot of different things and how you shouldn’t do this and you shouldn’t do that. Again I do believe that a lot of the things in the Bible that are considered to be a sin are bad things. There are also some things though that kind of conflict with others. If God loves us, which I believe he does, then why does he make us feel shame by including things in the Bible that causes us to feel that shame? 
4.	Being tied into a traditional religion. So while I do still believe in God and Jesus, I don’t really like being tied to a specific religion. I feel as though people believe what they believe. Can you even still believe in Jesus and God and even the Bible but not be considered a Christian or not associate with a specific religion or have a specific religion? Can’t you just believe what you believe?
5.	The last thing I want to kind of talk about is that I do still believe in God and Jesus, but I am kind of skeptical on how accurate the Bible is due to the fact that it could’ve been influenced or change by people. That people could and probably did decide what was to be included and excluded in the Bible, and the fact that the translations may not be completely correct or that there may be missing pieces to the Bible.

Thanks for Reading and I appreciate all of your comments. If there’s any resources like books or YouTube videos or anything else that you think I should read regarding the things I have stated please let me know because I am looking for sources and materials and things to research. I am still very much trying to decide what I believe and figure out myself and my life. I don’t mean to discredit anything in the Bible or God or anyone else’s beliefs. I’m just sharing this to hopefully get some insight and get some comments and things from other people who may be going through a similar experience or have gone through something like this in the past. I believe it is actually something probably everyone goes through in their life wondering and thinking and questioning these kinds of things.",Is it normal for a Christian to start to question things and be curious about things?,religion
140,"I can't say anymore that I ascribe to one religion. I have been Christian and Muslim, but I am looking to cultivate love for God, but feel the need to do it outside of (at least these two) religious traditions. I am not interested in developing a theology.   


I often pray, chant and meditate, in a variety of languages, including English, Arabic, Punjabi and Sanskrit.   


I have been reading a commentary on Narada's Bhakti Sutras and I feel like I am interested in incorporating contemplation of some form, image or icon in my worship for a time. The problem for me is that I feel more drawn toward Saguna and Via Negativa- I want to worship the Formless, Infinite, Limitless Lord, and I feel that by by repesenting God in a form or icon (like Christ, or Krishna etc), I can get easily distracted, and start to think that the image itself is the object of my worship. Likewise, I do not want to adopt an ""Ishta Deva"", or worship a form of God that I find inspiring for the same reason.   


Perhaps I could contemplate something like a Yantra, or Ying-Yang, but I don't see these images as  conducive to cultivating devotion to God, even though they may be good for other types of meditation.   


I would appreciate anyone's thoughts or ideas!

This is a prayer called  Saraswati Vandana Shloka

Ya Brahmachyuta Shankara Prabhritibhir Devaih Sada Pujita

Salutations to Devi Saraswati, Who is pure white like Jasmine, with the coolness of Moon, brightness of Snow and shine like the garland of Pearls; and Who is covered with pure white garments, Whose hands are adorned with Veena (a stringed musical instrument) and the boon-giving staff; and Who is seated on pure white Lotus, Who is always adored by Lord Brahma, Lord Acyuta (Lord Vishnu), Lord Shankara and other Devas, O Goddess Saraswati, please protect me and remove my ignorance completely

174,"I tried to take an 'attempt' at my own question?

Great question!!!

I think what we are trying to get at here?? The biggest problem??

Is that right from the start...EVERYTHING is a lie. The human condition itself is a lie...parents make us believe in 'Santa Claus'. They tell us, go to school, we will have 'fun'. Which is a lie. We go to Church and Priests tell us about God and heaven. Which is a lie. But...its only PARTIALLY a lie. But I 'believed' what my Mom told me, because the lie...was partially true? Some times, I had fun. A lot of the time, I was bullied. But my Mom cant' tell me that?? I would never go!! And no one can really PROVE WHAT HAPPENS or what doesn't happen after death. So the uncertainty allows for it. And the lies, always serve some type of purpose.

But governments lie, for political reasons. Trudeau is lying, because everything he says solidifies a political base. Mainly the elderly, and anyone who has an irrational fear of 'viruses'. And we don't really know a lot about 'viruses'. Anyone who says they do...is lying!! 1000 years from now, we might know more. But I doubt it? No one knows what happens when we trigger the immune response. Its the immune response itself that is the problem. We don't know. And really, shame on doctors for claiming they do. We need to all start from a more humble point of view. Humans know nothing. Our arrogance will fail us. Always. OF COURSE, the covid restrictions HELP the elderly. But cause damage to people like the homeless, and people with mental health and addiction problems. Trudeau is a politician, he doesn't care about them, because they don't vote! Rich people vote. Poor people have other priorities...like survival.

Lets see, 9-11. Everyone's opinion is different, but my opinion? The attack was real, USA and Islamic nations have been fighting a bloody war for about a century. And in war, civilian casualties are 'unfortunate', but 'acceptable'. Otherwise why nuke Japan? Its a survival of the fittest thing...

The lie? Well...it depends how 'far the rabbit hole' we want to go. Some people believe Osama Bin Laden, wasn't involved at all. USA scapegoated him, in order to justify the invasions of Iraq, and Afghanistan, to gain economic resources. For me? I find that too far fetched. And it denies the fact, that USA was ALREADY at war with Muslims, because of Israel. Its very difficult...let me re-phrase, to tell where the lies start, and the truth ends. That is why people lie in the first place. In my opinion, the attack was done with OSAMA BIN LANDEN as the master mind, and it was a horrific attack....but was 'understandable' from a 'survival of the fittest' military perspective.

The lie, came later. With the WMD's and justification for the invasion of Iraq, and Afghanistan. But...there may have been 'partial lies' right from the start. One building, may have been blown up by the CIA. And there is something about the Pentagon that doesn't make sense. Its extremely convoluted, and based in deception. Anyone who claims to know the ultimate 'truth', is lying. Because no one knows for sure. Don't know if your more confused, now than before.

I have never been a firm believer in god or really any other religion. I understand the purpose of them and sort of why they operate in the way they do, however ive always felt that it should be more inclusive. Ive often wondered where does all of the church's money go and why are the things they purchase so trivial, why not something that would help its followers? What happened to the hospitality of the church? Rhetorical questions. 

Why has no one replaced what once was a pillar of humanity. It now seems like a hateful group of elitests who dont want to know anything or provide anything. Why dont we start a church thats soul purpose is to provide for others? Do you think people would invest in that? I live in a very rural area and the only real sense of community you can find here is in a church, but i dont feel welcome because i am not of the same religios persuasion. Does this already exist? 

I guess here is a list of some of the beliefs/systems/whatever i would like to see in practice in a church.

Freedom of belief

Housing for those in need or those that would ""serve the church""

Free food, water, clothing, other necessities

Community driven food source

Medical assistance/straight up functional hospital/dr office

Preaching of kindness and charity and actual action taken towards their beliefs

Complete freedom of choice 

Other public facilities 

Freedom of belief, but also lack of persecution

I think different theories of god may just be different models.

There's just simply too much data, too many models, too many differing views.

Jesus came and listened to God and delivered a message and then Christianity was formed. 


Muhammad came and listened to God and delivered a message and then Islam was formed. 
 

These 3 individuals have something in common, they all listened to God and did what they could to relay what they believed needed to be told. They also took action and did not just sit by agreeing in silence. Whether or not you agree with how they are perceived by some, you cannot deny their impact on society. 


I believe that religion gets in the way of what is truly important, the personal relationship with God. 


Abraham condemned idol worship and commanded putting God first, yet we allowed religion to become an intercessor. 


Christianos translates to ""follower of Christ"" and Jesus pointed out God's authority, not the church, and it got him killed… Yet again we allowed religion to become an intercessor. 


Islam is literally translated as ""submission to the will of God"". This seems to be pretty important, how can you know what God wants if you are too focused on what your religion wants…? 


We, as a society, tend to over complicate matters… Maybe that is the reason that God continues to send prophets to spread his word, because we are still not listening to him… We place the prophets above us, so that it gives us an excuse when we fail…. 


These 3 religions also have something in common… The arrival of another… In Judaism it is the Messiah ben David… In Christianity and Islam, both believe that it will be Jesus… 


How many more times must we repeat the failures of the past? There will always need to be another prophet, if we keep rejecting God's will… Which is simple and can be summed up in one word… Harmony… 


This doesn't mean everyone being the same… God made us all different… There are almost 8 billion unique individuals on this planet and each one is just as important as the next. We need to celebrate each other's differences while working together for the whole.

""self"" or ""essence"" or the atman (purusha?), when enlightenment or moksha is achieved, according to non-dualist views, the atman becomes one with Brahman or the unification of everything, God, the absolute. Because to begin with Brahman is already present in every being. So as in if there was a drop of water (atman) that formed part of a bowl (jiva) and after death the drop leaves the bowl and goes back to the ocean (Brahman)

While for dualist views, atman would be more close to a fruit maybe, so while it is true that the tree (Brahman) has fruits, the fruit (atman-jiivatma or individual soul) and the tree (brahman-paramaatma or supreme soul) are different, and yet the fruit needs the tree to exist. Something like that?

Then, my question is, in dualist view in particular, if the atman is distinct from the ahamkara, citta and prakrti, or the ego, mind and embodiment, once in the stage of enlightenment, would there be the capacity of thought or self awareness? Because if the jiivatma is distinct from the paramaatma, in what state does the jiivatma stay when in enlightenment?

I mean, they even have ties to the alt-right here. Guess it was good I left New Atheism years ago. 

Yeah, I may not like Christians that much, but not all religions are like this and honestly I dislike the atheists more either way.

It seems like the whole world is falling into madness. Honestly, I actually dread the idea of Christians in their current form taking over. Imagine a world where Answers in Genesis teaches science and history, or where you could be put into an asylum for believing the world is more than a few thousand years old, or maybe even for believing the earth is round. Where scientific progress is outlawed, pretty much all minorities minus MAYBE racial ones (if we get lucky) are oppressed. You get the idea. Atheists obviously wouldn't create such a world, but imagine run by that freaking raving lunatic Richard Dawkins. We would probably fall into even more madness than if the current American Christians took over, and who else knows what would go wrong. This man goes around lecturing about things he clearly doesn't know shit about it, despises people who do, literally founded a pseudo-science, lies through his fucking teeth non-stop (such as how he's taken credit for inventing memes even though the current definition is NOT AT ALL WHAT HE ORIGINALLY MEANT, normal sane people would be outraged but instead he twists his own pseudo-scientific theory to lay claim to some pop culture trend, wtf?),

[CAESAR'S MESSIAH: The Roman Conspiracy to Invent Jesus - OFFICIAL VERSION | YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmEScIUcvz0)

&gt;Seven of today's most controversial Bible scholars reveal their shocking conclusions about the origins of Christianity. Based on the best-selling religious studies book by Joseph Atwill, this documentary shows that Jesus is not a historical figure, the events of Jesus' life were based on a Roman military campaign, his supposed second coming refers to a historical event that already occurred, the teachings of Christ came from the ancient pagan mystery schools, and the Gospels were written by a family of Caesars and their supporters, who left us documents to prove it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dissecting the history and literature of this time, the scholars show that the Gospels are a sophisticated pro-Roman multi-layered allegorical text that could not have been written by simple Jewish fishermen. Noting that the history officially provided by the Church does not hold up to rigorous scrutiny, the scholars agree that Christianity was used as a political tool to control the masses of the day, and is still being used this way today.

Atwill is rebutted in this video:

[Caesar's Messiah Debunked - Joseph Atwill's Covert Messiah Refuted | YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=MJ-SB4UKA54)

The debunking focuses on evidence for the existence of Christianity before the Roman conspiratorial intervention.  This fits with my thesis, that the Roman Illuminati redirected rather than invented Christianity.

Wikipedia offers a more mainstream perspective on [Jesus in comparative mythology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_comparative_mythology), noting the scholarly consensus that Jesus existed and was crucified by Pilate.  Thus an investigation of the historical Jesus should [begin at his death](https://cyberthal-ghost.nfshost.com/the-true-crucifixion-of-jesus-christ-reconciling-farsight-institute-padgettites-sasquatch-message-and-yajweh/), which left indelible forensic traces, both physical and psychic.

Atwill's videographers are secular materialists and thus prefer to believe that Jesus never existed, than that he did miracles and built faith which **The Powers That Be** then hijacked for their own ends.  However, Atwill's controversial boldness uncovers an important fragment of the truth:  The existence of a conspiracy too large for more sedate scholars to contemplate.

## The Meaning of ""Magic""

""Magic"" is simply the idea that consciousness has more impact on the material world than is currently acknowledged by mainstream physics.  The CIA describes it [thusly](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf):

&gt;B. Patterning. This technique involves use of the consciousness to achieve desired objectives in the physical, emotional, or intellectual sphere. It involves concentration on the desired objective while in a Focus 12 state, extension of the individual's perception of that objective into the whole expanded consciousness, and its projection into the universe with the intention that the desired objective is already a matter of established achievement which is destined to be realized within the time frame specified.  
&gt;  
&gt;This particular methodology is based on the belief that the thought patterns generated by our consciousness in a state of expanded awareness create holograms which represent the situation we desire to bring about and, in so doing, establish the basis for actual realization of that goal. Once the thought-generated hologram of the sought after objective is established in the universe it becomes an aspect of reality which interacts with the universal hologram to bring about the desired objective which might not, under other circumstances, ever occur. In other words, the technique of patterning recognizes the fact that since consciousness is the source of all reality, our thoughts have the power to influence the development of reality in time-space as it applies to us if those thoughts can be projected with adequate intensity. However, the more complicated the objective sought and the more radically it departs from our current reality, the more time the universal hologram will need to reorient our reality sphere to accomodate our desires. Monroe trainers caution against attempting to force the pace of this process because the individual could succeed in dislocating his existing reality with drastic consequences.

This is similar to the Christian concept of praying with the ""faith of a mustard seed"" to move mountains.

Banned user Illumixis comments:

&gt;This is what the Elite (some would call the Illuminati) know and it is the motive that ties most conspiracies together. It is WHY they control the entertainment industry to make giant spectacles - why they do massive false flag tragedies - because they harness all of that attention and energy to manifest their desired goals.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is why mass meditations around the world are crucial, and if any of the brighter types here remember those advertised here on reddit around 2012 and later, helped thrust our dimension literally in a different direction. In fact, the war, from the elite's perspective, has ALWAYS been about their souls and attention and life force.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Where attention goes, energy flows"" is an old, more primitive saying that is aware of this.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is also what mushrooms do. Mushrooms alter your brain chemistry in a way having to do with identity, and as a cascading effect, thrusting you into a higher state of awareness. (What I suspect is that Focus 12 state, but in steroids). Ultimately allowing you to affect your own reality in a profound way.  
&gt;  
&gt;Edit: forgot to mention that where this gets less pretty is how the different types of consciousnesses even affect this over all. Not all humans are conscious souls. Some are scripted, barely sentient (NPCs) - some humans have effectively animal souls - and some are totally conscious. You ""get what you pay for"" in a sense, as that is why the ""masses"" (largely empty headed and lacking a philosophical and moral compass) affect our reality, but only as a mass. Inversely, powerful consciousness can be formidable in small number, and even overpower the masses when organized - as evidenced by the elite.

Before you balk at the notion of unevenly-distributed consciousness, consider the implications of deja vu, Mandela Effect, and alternate timelines.  Your own soul may be distributed unevenly across multiple realities.

## The Power of Faith

TPTB carefully craft their mythology for magical purposes, as in the sacrifice of Princess Diana with lover Dodi and unborn child in a tunnel at the [13th](https://cyberthal-ghost.nfshost.com/base-12-the-beating-heart-of-time-universal-numerology-is-interspecies-emojis/#org9e7251a) pillar.  The trio represented [Isis, Osiris and Horus](https://cyberthal-ghost.nfshost.com/the-house-of-windsor-are-rakshasa-hybrids-who-ritually-cannibalized-diana-and-dodis-unborn-child/).  The claim that the New Testament story of Jesus was written with [many parallels to Horus](https://studylib.net/doc/8776077/parallels-between-the-lives-of-jesus-and-horus--an-egypti) is fraudulent.  However, the Roman Catholic Church did invent a de-facto Trinity of Father, Mary and Jesus, with Mary essentially being God's wife.  The archetype of Father Mother Child is so fundamental that it is the primary esoteric meaning of the number 3.  Therefore TPTB always seeks to recreate it in mass consciousness, for ritual purposes.

Traditional apologetics is simply not equipped to rebut this level of malign elite conspiracy.  Christianity has yet to even detect the existence of the hybrid ruling bloodlines, let alone safeguard their texts from manipulation.

There are consequences to credulity.  Christians must either [embrace the Mystic Reformation](https://cyberthal-ghost.nfshost.com/the-padgettite-mystic-reformation-corrects-the-bibles-obvious-moral-flaws-such-as-genocide-if-orthodox-christians-will-listen-no-its-not-a-cult-in-fact-the-bible-is-more-cultish/) or accept the ongoing decline of their faith among the rational, which will turn to total collapse when aliens make open first contact.

What are the odds that the truth about Jesus would be so obscure?  Wrong question.  Jesus came to our planet precisely because our rulers obscure the truth about God.

Treat these ideas as possibilities.  Belief is not required.  Seek God with your heart, and you shall find.  Nothing can prevent it.  That is why despite Roman corruption, people can still find God through the New Testament and Catholicism.

## Feedback

## Roman motives

&gt;Why would Rome create and then attack Christianity?  It doesn't make sense.

Rome was obviously correct to prioritize controlling Christianity.  However, I agree that a materialist explanation of events is insufficient.

Judaism was inspired by the powerful human ET [Yajweh](https://cyberthal-ghost.nfshost.com/marikas-transcripts-of-yajwehs-youtube-videos-by-number/) of Ibania, a negotiator who worked behind the scenes.  Christianity was inspired by the Ascended Master Yeshua of Krotea, who incarnated as Jesus and performed shamanic miracles.  Both were part of the 9-man delegation from Nibiru to elevate human thinking and found religions.

Rome was ruled by local elite bloodlines, ""Illuminati"", who had their own agenda which the Imperial cult served.  Worship is a valuable spiritual resource.

The result of this conflict of interest was the [Jewish-Roman wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish–Roman_wars), which were more extensive than is commonly supposed from the name.

&gt;So Rome didn't create Christianity at all? Was the Roman elite aware of the myth of the Jewish Messiah ahead of time or did they just react?

Yeshua did not intend to start a new religion.

The Roman Illuminati had the benefit of supernatural foresight into probabilistic futures.  I'm sure they had some understanding of Jewish messiah myths, from their experience conquering Jews.

Pilate was appointed by usurper Sejanus, and given the mission of extracting money to pay the bribes Sejanus needed to become Emperor.  Hence the blatant corruption at the Temple, which Jesus opposed.

If you want to learn more about Roman elite manipulation of Jewish myths, I recommend reading the books supporting the ""Caesar's Messiah"" video.  I don't rely on those myths as sources, so I haven't investigated it.

I was going through some extremely dark times and I found myself reading the Bible a lot. I believed in God because there are some indescribable things that I prayed for and have been answered. Some people say these things can be coincidence, but I really don’t think so. I also seriously doubt I would still be here without help from God. I overcame some really shitty stuff. 

However, as the dramatics of my life have settled, I find my faith fading.

Then! “And when the Lord smelled the pleasing Oder, the Lord in his heart said, I will never again curse the ground because of humankind again”. 

It continues about how it was pointless to flood everything anyway because it’s nature for humans to be inclined toward evil, but that’s not my point.

Anyway I've been reading a lot and posting here and there but I'm beginning to get a little concerned that some of my comments are getting a bit off topic due to the nature of my 'beliefs.' I have my own eclectic magickal practice which is essentially unique to me and it's through this I explore my spirituality. I don't think you can call this a religion or even part of one. Some religions include magic/k, Wicca for example but what I do is more a magickal practice that includes the devine as part of it. For me it is difficult to separate the two, so some of my comments can start to drift into areas that are more related magical theory than the divine entities themselves and what they mean.

While I don't actually worship anything I do have a small eclectic collection of deities that are important to me and whose principle I try to live by, so I feel there is religiosity in my practice but it's just a part of it... Which is a bit different to the he religious approach to the spiritual.

I respect this sub and I would like to know what you folks think. Should I set a distance in my posts in relation to the magick angle? (It's not like there aren't plenty of subs out there for that kind of thing). Or is it okay (within reason?) as it is part of my spiritual path?

83,"I'm studying the ethical and spiritual systems of multiple religions, and it seems almost all religions agree these, with very few exceptions. I'm trying to generalize them so they can be used as a template to compare new religions and religious movements. This incomplete list may also help to find movements that may not be religions, but may have a quasi-religious or cultish development.

1. Not kill. It seems some religions allow killing in some instances such as war, but almost all of them condemn killing innocent people.
2. Not steal. Some religions such as Judaism (and by extension, Christianity) allow to steal sometimes to save life or not starve, but in most cases stealing is considered bad and some form of private property is implicitly recognized as legitimate.
3. Not lie. Honestly is prioritized by virtually all religions, but again, sometimes lying is tolerated for exceptional reasons, such as is the case of Taqqiya in Islam.
4. Gender is recognized and gender roles are encouraged. Even the most liberal and decentralized religion seem to recognize the difference between genders, and sometimes assign or allow roles specific to genders. 
5. Rituals shall be practiced with some frequency. Be it prayer, meditation, yoga, offerings, etc.
6. Sexuality is regulated, or limited in some way. Religions may allow one or many wives, but usually they do not encouraged hook up culture or anything similar. The closest thing to an exception seems to be sacred prostitutes, but even in that case there are many rules and rituals around those acts. I think it makes perfect sense religions have these rules as for most of history we had no treatment for many STDs and bastard children were a problem for society.
7. There is a hierarchy of beings or dimensions, and non-human beings are often recognized as existing. There are often angels, demons, jinns or similar beings. Even religions that are non-theistic seem to recognize the existence of some kind of non-human beings, levels of hell or heaven, etc. Earth is often seen as an ""in-between"" realm (e.g. Midgard). 
8. There is a mechanism for Divine Justice according to the values of the Faith, but punishment and rewards are often deferred to after death or end times. For example, the Judgment Day or the Karma and reincarnation cycle. Some religions such as Voodoo seems to also believe we can control or negotiate this mechanism with divine beings.
9. There is a mechanism to communicate with the gods or an abstract idea of the divine, to ask for favors, forgiveness, etc.
10. Humans have a special role on Earth, such as protecting nature, owning it, worshipping God, Enlightenment, etc.

In the past it seems that many religions did not have an afterlife, but it seems most living religions today believe in some kind of afterlife. A noticeable case is how Judaism shifted from almost no emphasis in afterlife to openly recognizing it.",Common motifs shared by all religions,religion

Secondly, as the world got considerably more interconnected and smaller, there is no excuse of regional religious beliefs anymore. Thirdly basically every new religious movement that has come out in the last 200 to 300 years is mostly composed of already existing ideas put together in a taco bell/k platform/shovelware/whatever metaphor you want for recycling ideas/assets etc. And I think it shows the fallibility of modern people because every single one of them has been highly unreliable, e.g. Joseph Smith failing to retranslate the gold plates consistently.

91,"As we all know that 3 prime deities on Hindu Mythology are **Bramha, Vishnu** and **Mahesh**. Also who is more powerful among lord **Vishnu** and lord **Shiva** is debatable topic till date. But we all know they both are devotees and forever friend of each other.

It is said that Bramha Vishnu Mahesh(aka lord Shiva) are all knowing, also they are beings beyond our knowledge and comprehension. However, Bramha is described as mortal being who's age is described in this [link](https://www.booksfact.com/vedas/age-of-universe-and-brahma-as-calculated-in-vedas.html), and Vishnu Mahesh are described as eternal beings. Also remember that Vishnu is described a Supreme where Bramha is creative aspect and Shiva is destructive aspect.

So here is my theory, which is crazy or so.

Lets assume that lord Vishnu is actually a Supreme being and lord Bramha as well as Lord Shiva are other aspects of Vishnu, however when Shiva was born he inherited the destructive aspect as well as the eternal energy aspect of Vishnu making him prevail eternally, since Bramha were born after Shiva, the remaining energy was only sufficient for him to prevail for long period of time but not eternal.

Then comes the all knowing part. The trinity knows what is going to happen next, yet they don't take any actions to make and amendments to the current events. Why do they know what's going to happen, are they able to see the future? My theory is that the trinity has a special power which allows them to send their current experiences and learning to past self consciously or subconsciously. However, even having the power to change their present they choose not to, why? Because it will cause an alternate timeline, where another trinity exist, and now there will be 2 trinity exist at the same time but in 2 separate time lines. Which can cause havoc, because having more than 2 supreme will cause power balance conflict.

Then comes my next part of the theory. Lord Vishnu is being who wanted to make changes to past and present without effecting current time line as well as prevent creating other one due to making changes to past. Since his single consciousness was enough he had split himself in 2 aspects creator who we call Bramha and destroyer Shiva. Now collectively they can gain more knowledge upon research, and resolve the issue which is caused due to changing the past. Now we come to question why do they want to change the past.

Well, it is possible the future is already completed or reached to a certain end. So the trinity who is already at the end decided to share all knowledge to change the ending in way which doesn't create another timeline but alters their own timeline without adverse effects and ending is as they want it to be. Hence the current trinity is tasked with a mission to resolve the issue in best possible way. Which also means Bramha has already passed away. So we can say that we are living in present of Bramha which has already lived and shared the details to our current Bramha, hence he knows whats going to happen, and hence he wrote a book for Yamraja of who dies, how, why and when which explains why Yamdut certainly know where to go and when to go.

I speculate, that is the reason why so many gods were create so that they can manage the universe, whilst trinity try and figure out about time and modifications to it.

92,"Some manifestations of religious ecstasy today is very common and obvious: speaking in tongues, dancing, shaking, etc. We know even King David danced by the presence of God (and his wife got ashamed by it, 2 Samuel 6:14), so it is not a thing Pentecostals invented, and other religions have similar manifestations of ecstasy. Of course every religion has a different interpretation of what that means and if it comes from God or not, or even how it is expressed.

More traditional religions such as Catholicism and Judaism usually express that ecstasy internally, through the mystic experience, which is not less valid as an experience. I guess Buddhists and Hindus also have their own experiences on it.

Personally, infinite Peace has been one of the direct experiences I had with the divine. Everything becomes so clear and complete, and just thinking some people have never felt even a second of that makes me sad, as it is indeed a life changing experience. It is indeed more a spiritual experience than religious, but religion helped me a lot to articulate and express it using words and concepts it defined.

I find it odd that most arguments for or against religion often become theological discussions, considering that mystic experiences are often the reason people come or stay in religion.",Why is religious ecstasy is often ignored when discussing religion?,religion

96,"Hello Brothers, I am writing to you because I have a dilemma that won't let me sleep tonight, and it is something I have been struggling with for a long time. First, this is going to be a long post... but here I go. Let me introduce myself first, I am a 31 year old man, and although in the title I refer to myself as a Christian, I am actually a Catholic.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is that I don't know exactly what I am... I mean, I was baptized as a Catholic, but I don't know if I fit into the belief system, but to keep things simple, let's say that I believe in God, Jesus as the savior and I try to live my life as more consistent with his teachings. Anyway, I am writing this because I would like some fellow follower of Christ to be able to share his opinion about my dilemma.

&amp;#x200B;

But aside from being devoted to God, I've also been passionate about heavy metal music since I was about 17 years old. It is something that I already have in my heart, I connect with that music almost on a spiritual level, and I know that this will sound like heresy, but if they give me a choice between God and heavy metal, I don't know which one I would choose.

&amp;#x200B;

As everyone should know by now, heavy metal has a very strong relationship with the occult, Satanism, as well as anti-religious sentiments. This is not a law, even the founders of the genre like Black Sabbath have denied their whole career that they are a ""satanic"" band. There is a lot of metal that doesn't address satanism or hatred towards religion, and if they do at least they do it in a subtle way. Paradoxically, there are bands like Slayer where some of its members are religious, however both the image of the band and its lyrics are aggressive and offensive towards christianity.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a teenager let's just say that I was very influenced by that anti-Christian sentiment of many metal bands, and I refused to follow God or even believe in him. I spent many years wandering in the abyss, years for which I deeply regret, until one desperate day I begged God for mercy for me and for all humanity (in my eyes, everything in the world was chaos and hatred) and something ""clicked"" on me. I began to believe and have faith, without complicating myself too much and my life took a radical turn since then.

&amp;#x200B;

But my passion for metal was always there, only for a long time I rejected ""satanic"" or anti-religious bands because I thought it was a sin to listen to them or that they would be a bad influence that would lead me to perdition again. Let's see, I'll be honest, I love a lot of those bands. Morbid Angel, Deicide, Mercyful Fate, Dissection, Emperor, Mayhem, Dark Funeral are bands that I consider to have legendary albums with an excellent musical level, and even some of their very dark lyrics are attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

And yes... that's something I must confess, I like the darkness, I'm drawn to it. I think that all the conflict between heaven and hell that the bible relates is fascinating, and I also like the demonic themes of many metal albums. I even find the figure of Satan something that catches my attention, although I try to reject it. The problem is that when they insult Jesus too much, or criticize Christianity and his values ​​in a certain way, that's when I feel somewhat uncomfortable. In particular what I find most uncomfortable are the graphic images of Jesus in obscene or violent situations. I mean, yeah, I get it, a lot of blood has been spilled in the name of God, but it was not Christ's fault, He even died for all of us (included the so called heretics). He loves all of us deeply.

In reality, many metal bands have admitted that much of all satanic theming is paraphernalia that only serves for shock value. Venom for example, one of the most influential metal bands that were also the first to adopt a ""satanic"" ideology, in reality they are not, another example is the case of Slayer that I mentioned earlier. In fact, many of the most famous and emblematic metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Slipknot, Pantera, Judas Priest, Opeth or Gojira are not really ""satanic"" and although some of them may profess some feeling of dislike of religion they usually do it in a very subtle way. On the other hand, most of these bands declare themselves atheists, agnostics, and some even Christians.

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, deep anti-Christian sentiment is more characteristic of extreme metal, especially black metal. And there comes my dilemma, as a follower of Jesus and as a metalhead I feel that both passions collide with each other, and they are not always compatible. In the case of the satanic bands that I mentioned, although I admire them on a musical level and in a certain way their themes, I don't share many of their ideas. The thing is, ever since I started following God, my life has been nothing but a blessing. I used to hate life, hate the world, people and God himself, and many of these feelings have changed a lot. Heck, even recently I prayed a lot to God to help me raise money to attend one of the biggest metal festivals in my country, and it's a wish that was fulfilled. Therefore, perhaps for God my passion for this music is not entirely a sin.

&amp;#x200B;

Several months ago I even spoke with a priest and he told me that he does not believe that listening to those bands is a sin, above all because what interests me most is the musical aspect and because I have my Christian values ​​well rooted within me, which It is something that he realized. But he warned me to keep a balance in what I watch and listen, as music can influence one way or another. I must say that I don't just listen to heavy metal, obviously I love rock, especially classic rock and hard rock (Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Beatles, AC/DC) but I also really like classical music, jazz and some blues and folk music.

&amp;#x200B;

So with all this I should feel free to listen to whatever I want, right? Well, I don't know, I'm not sure. For example, as I said, Christ has brought only blessings to my life, many of them from before I followed him, only I didn't see it. But listening to a band insult and mock him, I feel like I'm being ungrateful to him. On the other hand, sometimes when I listen to black metal I feel something ""strange"" like some kind of sinister presence... this may be superstition, and it's kind of funny that a few rebellious teenagers were able to create music that somehow contains some dark force but I don't know... there's a certain mysticism behind that music, that's why I try to listen to it very carefully and I don't do it that often.

&amp;#x200B;

Many would say, well then why not listen to Christian metal? after all there are many bands with those themes. But I don't know, I've heard some and honestly they don't catch my attention, although I admit they are good. I'm just not looking for religion in heavy metal, but I'm not looking for anti-religion either. Somehow I feel like religion and heavy metal aren't quite compatible, not because it's wrong. But it's like in The People vs Larry Flynt movie, when they say nobody wants religion in their porn, I prefer metal when it comes to topics like war, destruction, death, horror and so on because I feel like when I listen to it it's a experience of catharsis, besides I will not deny that I like those themes in art and entertainment.

I'll also be honest, although I love God, I don't fully share or understand his love for humanity. This is because I was hurt by people many times in a terrible way during my youth, which led me to distrust and have a certain hatred to people in general. That feeling has waned noticeably, but sometimes I identify with the misanthropic lyrics of many metal bands. And this is another inconsistency, since God says that someone cannot love Him and hate his brothers at the same time. I have no friends, no wife and no children, and the only people I love are my family.

Then again, I could also stick with the myriad of metal bands that aren't openly Satanist or anti-religious. Cannibal Corpse, for example, one of my favorite bands, they play really brutal music and they usually don't tackle those issues and stick with the slasher horror aspect of death metal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that frustrates me a lot is the attitude of many members of the metal community. That is to say, like me in the past, many believe that to listen to metal they have to hate Christianity, or that one cannot be a metalhead and follow God. This makes me cringe, because I know that it is not true at all, and it frustrates me to see men from 30 onwards who still have that attitude. I don't want to say that all metalheads should suddenly convert to Christianity (although that may benefit them) but it exasperates me how as many are as ""sheep"" as the Christians they criticize so much. In itself, metal is freedom, one can be a metalhead and believe or not believe whatever they want, and God gave us free will. But this is one of the reasons why I don't frequent metalhead social circles.

Well, I think I'm giving it a lot of thought, I hope I haven't made you dizzy. I am also aware that I can seem too immature for a 31 year old, and this seems more like the anguish of a teenager. But I had a late maturity, because I was practically lost and I didn't have time to meditate on these things. Finally, what do you think about all this?.",A christian metalhead struggle,religion

I hope everyone is well, I just have a very simple question to my dear non Muslim brothers and sisters.

My question is very simple, how does a man named Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) (ﷺ) know that a humans body has 360 joints? 

حَدَّثَنَا حَسَنُ بْنُ عَلِيٍّ الْحُلْوَانِيُّ، حَدَّثَنَا أَبُو تَوْبَةَ الرَّبِيعُ بْنُ نَافِعٍ، حَدَّثَنَا مُعَاوِيَةُ، - يَعْنِي ابْنَ سَلاَّمٍ - عَنْ زَيْدٍ، أَنَّهُ سَمِعَ أَبَا سَلاَّمٍ، يَقُولُ حَدَّثَنِي عَبْدُ اللَّهِ بْنُ فَرُّوخَ، أَنَّهُ سَمِعَ عَائِشَةَ، تَقُولُ إِنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏""‏ إِنَّهُ خُلِقَ كُلُّ إِنْسَانٍ مِنْ بَنِي آدَمَ عَلَى سِتِّينَ وَثَلاَثِمَائَةِ مَفْصِلٍ فَمَنْ كَبَّرَ اللَّهَ وَحَمِدَ اللَّهَ وَهَلَّلَ اللَّهَ وَسَبَّحَ اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ اللَّهَ وَعَزَلَ حَجَرًا عَنْ طَرِيقِ النَّاسِ أَوْ شَوْكَةً أَوْ عَظْمًا عَنْ طَرِيقِ النَّاسِ وَأَمَرَ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ نَهَى عَنْ مُنْكَرٍ عَدَدَ تِلْكَ السِّتِّينَ وَالثَّلاَثِمِائَةِ السُّلاَمَى فَإِنَّهُ يَمْشِي يَوْمَئِذٍ وَقَدْ زَحْزَحَ نَفْسَهُ عَنِ النَّارِ ‏""‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ أَبُو تَوْبَةَ وَرُبَّمَا قَالَ ‏""‏ يُمْسِي ‏""‏ ‏.‏

'A'isha reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Every one of the children of Adam has been created with three hundred and sixty joints; so he who declares the Glory of Allah, praises Allah, declares Allah to be One, Glorifies Allah, and seeks forgiveness from Allah, and removes stone, or thorn, or bone from people's path, and enjoins what is good and forbids from evil, to the number of those three hundred and sixty joints, will walk that day having saved himself from the Fire.
Abu Taubah said: ""Perhaps he said: 'Will reach the evening.'""

Sahih Muslim 1007

From this Hadīth (saying of the Prophet ﷺ), we know that a humans body has 360 joints, and from science we also know the same. He could have said any other number, 1-359 or he could have exceeded that number, but it's exactly 360. If Islam is not from God, of Islam is not the right way, then how could this be?

I met a girl  there and we added each other on WhatsApp. She’s the sweetest person ever. I got to meet more of her friends. The reason we got along so well was because she told me she was Muslim and was scared to tell me in fear that I’d hate her for it, which, of course, I didn’t. So I was always fascinated by religions and was always open to my friends telling me about theirs. They taught me about Islam and I started having doubt in my religion and started to think maybe their religion is more correct. Whenever I asked them any question, they would always be able to answer it even though they were young than me and the answers were so reasonable. Any questions they asked me, I tried my best to answer but I sometimes I wouldn’t have an answer and it felt like they had things figured out more. The reason why I’m so frustrated is that in the Islamic religion, they believe that anyone who isn’t a Muslim will got to Hell which made me feel like oh wow that’s kind of harsh. The problem is I’ve become more worried about going to Hell. I’ve never been good and believing any religion is true to it’s fullest. I’ve always wanted to do whatever I could to not face whatever happens in Hell. The problem is, if you’re not Muslim they believe you go to Hell which made me want to become Muslim to be saved. Problem is that in the scriptures, and the religion I’m apart of now, says that if you fully understand the religion and STILL chose to leave it you’re automatically sent to Hell. Maybe I got that wrong? But I feel like both religions could be true and I don’t know which one to believe so whether I do anything I’ll go to Hell.

It was because I met amazing people and I knew I wouldn’t be able to seem them again. It always made me frustrated because they’d talk about how they felt the spirit so strong there and I never felt it. I was jealous. I wanted that spiritual feeling I used to feel when I was younger. I feel like I never feel the spirit anymore and ever since I got back from FSY I feel like I don’t even belong to the church. They’re so much different than how I am and how I feel.

109,"I’m a poet, and more generally, a person fascinated with words and their meanings and uses. And while not traditionally religious myself, I have always found the complexity and depth of religious language and images unparalleled. I think that was the domain of religion for a very long time; if we wanted to talk about something profound, we would use religious language by default. 

These days, this is less true it seems, for various complex reasons. People these days often try to use value-neutral jargon to conceptualize and describe the most subjective aspects of their experience, which I believe is a tragedy in many ways. Such language simply does not contain anywhere near the same amount of information, it doesn’t impart the same emotional impact, it doesn’t have the same moral valence and implications for action. 

Many formerly religious terms have also aggregated a double meaning, a cynical antonym of the original usage. I was at a poetry workshop recently and the whole group tripped over my use of the word “pious” in one piece; to everyone there, it only had one meaning, the newer one, being “characterized by a hypocritical concern with virtue or religious devotion; sanctimonious”. No one, save my poetry mentor, even knew that the word had an original meaning which was positive.

I’m not complaining about this phenomena, merely making observations. I like trying to reclaim and revivify old religious language in my work, because I think it’s just too valuable to be forgotten or corrupted by nihilism. But it also makes me wonder where we are getting that need for profound language met now, if not from religion?

117,"I've noticed a lot of misinformation about otherkin floating around social media, so I thought I'd make a very different post this time around, instead of talking about my Satanic beliefs, I'd talk about something that doesn't come up a lot.

By the strictest definition, the word otherkin describes people who identify partially or entirely as nonhuman on some non-physical level.

Now this might not make a lot of sense but let me explain. The idea is most often given a spiritual explanation, a person is born with a soul that isn't human by nature. This is how I believe it works and it's why I'm posting to this sub, for the sake of this post I'm going to focus primarily on the spiritual side.

The idea has been compared to being transgender in a few ways, usually either to mock trans people, or a more common sentiment recently, to claim that it's a parody of or appropriating the trans struggle (as if transphobes wouldn't be transphobic without making bad faith comparisons to otherkin). While this comparison can be helpful to explain the idea of being otherkin, I think it's pretty obvious why this can also be harmful to both communities. I've also seen it called a ""furry thing"", and even some claims about zoophilia, but I think these claims are far enough out that I don't need to explain why they're incorrect.

I think a better way to frame it is through the idea of dysphoria/dysmorphia, which outside the context of being trans exist as issues with the body not matching one's self image. Even if we drop the idea of a spiritual cause, the nature of dysmorphia being psychological is a perfectly acceptable explanation for the otherkin experience, as the desired body doesn't need to be possible, it just so happens that for trans people it is possible.

For me and many others, this identity is a core part of our occult practice. When practicing witchcraft, a non-human soul makes a pretty noticeable difference in how we approach things. My fae spirit for example leads me to work with fae spirits and magic when performing my rituals. Occult and witchcraft communities who ignore or otherwise object to the idea of otherkin are, frankly, ignoring the way magic works entirely in my opinion.

I could go on more, like on the history of this belief and how it's evolved over hundreds of years at least, or the more recent terminology used within the community, such as the distinction between otherkin (usually referring to a supernatural being) and therian (usually referring to a mundane animal), but I'd rather keep this post as a basic introduction and raising of awareness.

Now onto the next part, this is also an AMA, so I'll be answering any good faith questions asked about this belief and identity system. I also encourage anyone else involved with the community to add on their own information. Like I said at the beginning, there's a lot of harmful misinformation going around lately and I want to be able to clear some of that up. Let's just try to make sure this doesn't turn toxic.",Otherkin Information Post &amp; AMA,religion

 I was born and raised within the sect of Jehovah's Witnesses, that is, I have seen and experienced many things there.
I am 18 years old, and soon I will be 20 knowing that I wasted the best years of my life and missed my best birthdays because of a stupid and baseless “belief”.

Since I was little, I saw how rotten Jehovah's Witnesses are, they have an superiority feeling and they think they are better than others, or as they say, only they know and follow the ""true religion"", but it doesn't end here, they try to convey an image of “united and happy” people to outsiders, but inside the situation is quite different.

They created a system of hours, in other words, they count and accumulate the hours that they spend spreading the “word of God” (going door to door to bother others in the middle of the morning) that is, they count the hours that they spend doing this and at the end of each month they have a total of hours, and this is often a reason for competition and distinction between them.  If you have fewer hours, you are excluded and treated as someone “spiritually weak and inferior”, but if you are someone with many hours and go out often to spread the word, you are considered a great company and are always included in recreation.

 They also have a system of punishment for those who commit a “grave sin”, the so-called disfellowshipping.  If you commit any sin and the elders of your congregation find out, you will be penalized, this means that from that moment on no one will be able to talk to you, including your family, without exceptions, people will treat you as if you did not exist.  They say this is an “act of love” and is meant for a person to repent of their sins, but there is literally NOTHING in the Bible that speaks or encourages such a punishment, it was something they created (as well as 100% of their beliefs) and it is something totally inhumane, which has proven to be fatal and disastrous several times.

There have been cases of people being taken to suicide because of this “punishment” from Jehovah's Witnesses, people who couldn't handle the pressure of feeling rejected, ignored even by their own family and sank into depression, seeing suicide as the only way out.

As much as the person repents, Jehovah's Witnesses will always remember you as the ""disfellowshipped"" and consequently you will be treated badly.

There are numerous cases of ped0philia and harassment involving Jehovah's Witnesses, I myself was a victim of one of these cases, at the time I was 16 years old and had just been baptized, Jehovah's Witnesses do not encourage you to go to the police, they say so that everything is resolved with the “elders” of your congregation, and I went after them, but they did absolutely nothing, they just covered up the case and gave the harassing pedophile a rag, meanwhile they spread rumors that I had provoked the man first, and that's why he didn't resist.

 They encourage all brothers not to look for and not listen to any content or reports that exposes the truth and dirt that is within their religion.

When I decided that I would no longer be part of this sect, I felt free.

In all my 18 years of life, the worst people I ever met were Jehovah's Witnesses.

They don't want you to serve God out of love or will, they make you scared, they hold you and suffocate you until there's nothing left, it's like an abusive relationship that makes you believe it's your true love but in fact it will kill you little by little, and getting out of it is liberating.",Jehovah's Witness is the worst religion ever,religion

The doctors told the family there was no brain activity,  so he couldn't be aware of anything.  But his wife told him if he could hear her to open his eyes and with apparently an extreme amount of effort did so and looked into her eyes then slipped back into unconscious.  Later she asked him to squeeze her hand if he heard her and with the same effort did so.

130,"Christians, why do you believe that Jesus ""accomplished"" something on the cross? 

I was, in a time in my life, having visions and dreams about Jesus and read Jesus's teachings. I was completely believing his way is true because he said deep things that makes sense. Like why judging someone before looking at yourself and your part? (the dirt in your friend's eye before taking it out of your eye). Why resent people why cling to material things? (someone takes your coat? Giv'm your shoes too).That the way we see is the light in us and if it turns evil and we see all bad we go out (eye is the lamp of the body). That heaven is being innocent like kids. So many wonderful messages. (I am not christian and there are not a majority of christianity where I live)

In a dream I saw myself reading about Jesus and non-stop crying and realising I should have said I am a christian after I was asked what my religion was and I was shy and uncertain how to say it and said nothing when someone sayd on my behalf 'astrology alchemy that kinda stuff'. I knew that someone was wrong but said nothing.

But something about christian theology I don't understand. Why do you believe Jesus accomplished something on the cross? Wasn't he murdered? Wasn't Jerusalem destroyed after that? And salvation.. how was that accomplished by Jesus being tortured (luckily he had painkillers) and killed? I honestly don't understand. It seems to me that this is sad. He was persecuted and betrayed for a few pieces of silver or something. And died. How can that be good or in anyway god's plan? To execute this plan people had to completely disobey god. Judas had to covet the silver, The Roman authorities had to commit murder, all of the crowd had to stand by and not do anything to save an innocent man. I truely understand why this looks like the death of god, like evil in the making. But why was that any kind of victory? Why is that supposed to ""cleanse"" from sins? Isn't that a barbaric belief that a sacrifice of a person cleanses and restores peace with god as if god was bloodthirsty? Wasn't god completely against the practice of human sacrifices? Jesus said we all are sons of god and should call him father. so why saying Jesus was the only son and god sacrificed him to cleanse us, yet people murdered him. So god gave people permission to murder? There were times written in the bible when god did permit to kill people, out of self defense or in oppression or war but never as a sacrifice, substitutional atonement or 'cleanse'.

151,"I’m currently almost 30 and I believed in God heavily my whole life. I read my bible 3x a day, I played Christian radio to fall asleep to every night, I prayed when I woke up, before eating, leaving my house for the day, went to church every week etc. By the time I was 9 I wanted to become a priest, I knew about 70% of the whole bible. My family and I went through so many hardships like you wouldn’t even believe me and I’m too lazy to type them all out, but I’ll tell u some….

I never saw or lived with my parents when I was growing up. We both knew of eachother we just couldn’t be with eachother for reasons I won’t mention on here. When I turned 12 was when I finally lived with my mother, I still haven’t seen my Dad till now.. My sister and I got kidnapped when I was 6-8. We didn’t have electricity from 2002-2012 we were so poor sometimes I would eat only bread and drink water with sugar in it ONCE a day etc etc… Throughout all the hardships, not once did I blame God or lose my faith. I was very devoted. However when I turned 20 in 2017, I started doing tons of research regarding Christianity and later on religion as a whole, I questioned my parents, my pastors, teachers, basically anyone who was a devoted Christian or seemed to have answers. I never got any answers that made sense. They ultimately had way less knowledge than I had and that was because I had researched for about 2 months, compared to priests and pastors that spent 30+ years in the field. 

I noticed how everyone just relied on a “God”/creator who lived in the sky to take care of us and we were supposed to worship and praise him our whole lives even though no one had any solid proof of his existence or his powers… If you don’t believe in him, you would burn in a pit of fire for all eternity even if you were a very good, kind, just, honest, polite, caring, generous person. 

Don’t get me started on the only proof we have of “God”, The Bible. The worst book ever written, with so many inconsistencies, contradictions, oppression, violence, genocide, prejudice, hate, …. Should I go on??
1 thing I’m sure  is, Jesus Christ and other people from the bible may have existed, but the bible has been translated and rewritten so many times over the centuries that how do you know that it is still accurate? 

I somewhat agree with the reason Christianity (Religion) was created, it gave people a sense of belonging, it made people act civilized with a good conscience instead of acting barbaric etc… However in this day and age, most people aren’t barbarians anymore, most people know better, I can argue everyone knows right from wrong. There are laws, regulations and consequences to stop people from acting upon their animalistic instincts. There is so much information today that proves there isn’t really a Christian “God” in the sky…

I’m not an atheist, I do believe there must be a higher power somewhere who made the universe and the life within in. I just don’t believe in a God in the sky who sits on a throne and gives billions of people a false sense of hope, that you must worship and pray to, knowing 100% of the time he will ignore you… I guess he’s not really ignoring you because he doesn’t even exist in the first place :/",Help me Christians,religion

*for God created us for incorruption,
and made us in the image of his own eternity, but through the adversary's envy death entered the world, and those who belong to his company experience it* (Wisdom 2:28)

It is seen as something that should not exist and which goes against our nature.

This is similar to what existentialist Simone de Beauvoir said in her essay on death:

*There is no such thing as a natural death: nothing that happens to a man is ever natural, since his presence calls the world into question. All men must die: but for every man his death is an accident and, even if he knows it and consents to it, an unjustifiable violation.*

Recently, my son told me that his friend told him that praying with your hands together like you see in the movies is wrong. He told him that isn’t the correct way to pray. The correct way to pray is with someone and you put your hands on their shoulders and they put their hands on your shoulders.

I found this a bit different as I’ve never heard of this, I told my partner and MIL about the conversation and they both said this is weird for my sons friend to be telling our son this. My partner went as far as to suggest it was inappropriate and hoped this older friend of his wasn’t trying to take advantage of him. While I did find it strange, my mind didn’t go to what my partners did.

I would like to know what your thoughts are receding this. Should I be speaking to my sons friends parents about their prayer method and faith? Or is my partner thinking too much into this? I’m feeling conflicted as I understand faith is a personal subject.

Any insight would be appreciated",Holding Shoulders to Pray,religion

Both religions fascinate me as an atheist, and I've actually done some research into Satanism just for the fun of it. My girlfriend is Pagan, and I'm a huge fan of black metal, which is a scene filled with Pagan and Satanic culture. That being said, I'm not sure which one to choose for my topic. Again, I may be wrong here, but I feel like Paganism would allow me a greater access to resources and a wider variety of things to discuss, since it's been around for hundreds and hundreds of years.

I'll have to have 6 hours ""in the field"", such as participating in events/activities (if they allow me), observing first-hand, interviewing people within the culture/religion, etc., and there's not much in terms of Satanic culture where I am.

-	The big one was that **sounds are sacred**. There is an important coming-of-age ritual where the guru (iirc this was the word that the person telling me about this used) whispered the special sound or name into the practitioner's ear. The sound/name was a big deal and none of the initiated said it to their children until it was the right time for them to hear it
-	It was definitely founded in the 20th century. I think it was the 50s or 60s I'm hazy
-	I want to say it had around 20,000 adherents when I looked it up a few years ago. It might have more or less now or I might be misremembering. Definitely less then 500,000.
-	The person telling me this came from California so I'm guessing the religion is located there. I believe they had a community where adherents lived together

""Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved- you and your household"" - Act 16:31

Now this struck me as something of a loophole since it implies that so long as at least one member of your household accepts Jesus, the whole household will be saved, which would leave the rest of the household free to pursue other leisure activities. We could even redefine larger communities as households so that fewer people still would need to believe in Jesus and saving more people- a real savings!

217,"Someone posted in another thread a point about recon polytheism that reminded me of this:

Recon polytheism tends to de-emphasize the relevancy of its lore/myth/textual components. Recons in particular may not in particular take these stories to mean anything other than than personalities of the gods/beliefs of the people of the time. 

Meanwhile, for Chinese, Japanese and to a lesser degree, Hindu/Sanatana Dharma beliefs (Let me know if I'm off base), it seems we are less likely to consider our texts as just pure allegory. In my circle, in particular we tend to consider the creation stories a bit more ""true"" than false. These stories revolve more around creating lands, raising mountains etc. moreso than anything in a Genesis style fashion. Humans are de-emphasized. There's much less of a lin delimiting humans from gods as well, as they are depicted much like humans are. 

I think it's important to remember in particular that while Eastern beliefs possess superficial similarities to polytheism in Europe and North Africa, they are still very different from each other and spent thousands of years apart from each other.",A difference of Eastern Polytheism from Recon/Neo beliefs,religion
218,"There is valid and relevant criticism of religion as a whole, but I find most religious criticism falls into two categories:

 - **Criticism of one religion (often Christianity) that is often generalized to all religions.** Not all religions have gods, not all religions have One Powerful God, not all religions even believe in an afterlife, not all religions have a centralized organization or army... and yet those things are often used to critizice ALL religions. Another thing is that often the criticism of religion is based on complex conflicts and prosecution that had more to do with nationalism and ethnic conflicts than religion itself, and yet religion gets all the blame.

- **Criticism of religion on materialistic terms, but only to religion**. This is odd because humanists often believe in many things that can be considered metaphysical, such as human rights. There is no scientific reason to believe humans are equal or even that they deserve to be equal and free. In fact, nature evolves into inequality all the time. We agreed to assume we all are equal at least in some aspect, though. Another thing is faith. We also have faith in friends, family, ideologies, countries, etc. with no problem so the criticism of faith itself is odd. I understand criticizing religious faith, but it is odd ""faith"" as a whole is often criticized as if it was something exclusive to religion (it isn't).

Another thing is that often people believe religion is reduced to a mythology, when in fact it is a complex and very complete system of values, traditions, history, styles, ethics, etc. that evolved for centuries and have a reason to be and persist. Religion is not like just a few old stories and a belief in God, and never was. I would say religion is more like an ideological complex rather than a belief.

221,"I'm asking on the context  of every pagan religion, though I prefer to choose Greek Pagan religion for it is by far the best documented pagan religion we have.

It seems that Greeks rather had many religions instead of one. Almost every god had their own temple, rituals, etc. and they were associated with cities (Athena, Crete, etc.), people and times (Titans).

Some of those gods were in fight with other gods, sometimes what was considered sacred for a god was not for another, some gods were foreign and integrated into Greek religion, etc.

Some people argue that they practiced the same religion because they shared the same mythologies and stories, but that is not true either... their myths were often very diverse. There are like 3 stories of how humans arrived to Earth in Greek religion.

Also we consider Christianity, Islam and Judaism as separate religions even when they have plenty of overlaps, probably as much as the cults of each pagan Greek god... yet we consider Greek cults as one religion?

8,"When people think back to how people conceptualised God in the Middle Ages, particularly during Medieval Christendom there is a focus on dread and terror. And to be fair....there was some of that. But often times the narrative is presented where in the Middle Ages it was just all dread and terror and that's it and its during the modern period that we have either ""discovered"" or ""rediscovered"" the concept of God's Love that those backwards Medievals just seemed to missed. This mindset is present, whether it some contemporary Christian or Non-Christian notions of how Medieval Christians thought.

The reality is actually much more complicated and different than that. It was actually during the Medieval period that you see developed some of the deepest insights into God's love. St Anselm and St Thomas Aquinas for instance develop St Augustine's notion of the Holy Spirit being the Love of God which manifests itself to humanity. Among the school of thought known as the 'Victorines' figures such as Hugh of St Victor and Richard of St Victor strongly focus on the role ""love"" played in the Trinitarian understanding of God and saw a connection between the Trinitarian understanding of Love, the sacrificial Love demonstrated on the cross, and the Love a Christian is to display in the practise of Good works and love of neighbour. This would be replicated earlier in the East in the Hymns on Divine Love by St Symeon the New Theologian. St Julian or Norwich would in turn focus on the Love of Christ for humanity in terms of solidarity with humanity's pain and suffering.

Moreover when thinking of Christ, in previous generations the image of Christ that was sometimes emphasised was Christ the conqueror out of the grave. In Medieval Christendom you start to see the shift and full development of what is common in some modern understandings of Christ the ""friend"" is is by us. This in turn flows out of an understanding of the 'Love of God"" which is tied to the concept of filial, which is Love as friendship. The idea that God seeks friendship with humanity. Even Dante, in his dark poetry going through purgatory and Hell, in the end when he goes through Paradise, is chasing after his ""beloved"" Beatrice who is an allegorical representation of theology and his pursuit of the Love of God.",Medieval Christian theology and the concept of the 'Love of God'.

42,"## Sasquatch says what!?

The [Sasquatch Message Book 3](https://cyberthal-ghost.nfshost.com/the-sasquatch-message-to-humanity-book-3-earth-ambassadors-cooperation/) makes clear that the Biblical Jesus is a falsified portrayal:

&gt;“One of the regular things that you experience are those among your people who beg you to pray to Jesus for salvation or redemption from the evils of my people as if we are demons sent to deceive you. Those with these beliefs are actually the ones who have been tricked or fooled by man and do not know what Divine Love truly is otherwise they would not make a judgment on something they have no knowledge in. What they fail to realize is that my people know the prophet known as Jesus, as we worked with him and guided him throughout his incarnations on Earth. Jesus was a Shaman who healed using energy and natural tools such as crystals, herbs, and roots. All these healing methods are now considered to be evil or pagan according to the very people that look to Jesus for salvation and for most of your man-made religions, but in reality, these shamanic practices are a way of cooperating and connecting with nature as intended.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“My people were here millions of years before any humans, but Jesus is what you call an Ascended Master; a soul that is pure and has never lost connection with ancient universal knowledge and truth or with the Star Elder Councils. Christ has incarnated many times on Earth to be a teacher and example of love for humanity, yet he is usually only recognized as being Jesus, the man born of a virgin, rather than all of his incarnations that he has dedicated towards raising the spiritual consciousness of humanity.”

Christians will automatically reject this message unless the claim is proven directly.  They won't tolerate a passive-aggressive undermining of their faith.

## Channeling defended

I viewed the Sasquatch Message as speculative fiction until I came across this Padgettite book, which explained that one cannot auto-dismiss channeling without discarding lots of scripture, which is channeled:

[The Secret Second Coming: What If the Church Got It Wrong, by Patricia Doyle](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53889165-the-secret-second-coming)

Telepathy is highly plausible as the lingua franca of the galaxy.  The story of Babel indicates humans once spoke a semi-telepathic language.  How else would spirits communicate but telepathy?  I was forced to admit that Patricia's defense of channeling was prima facie plausible.

## Crucifixion challenge

However, I am an apologeticist.  I know that the crux of Christianity's credibility is the crucifixion and resurrection.  So I immediately went to the strongest evidence in an attempt to disprove both the Padgettites and Sasquatch together.

I redid the fundamentals of Christian crucifixion apologetics, incorporating other credible esoteric Disclosures.  Shockingly, I found that the Bible was less credible than some of the other sources.  It had certain corruptions, exaggerations, and revisions serving ungodly agendas.  These were obvious and cartoonish in hindsight.

Overall, the Sasquatch Message was the most reliable source of deep historical info, although it doesn't cover every topic in depth, and barely discusses Jesus at all.  (Honest sources follow Cosmic Law and Disclose only what is properly theirs to share, so as not to infringe on the free will of those who have incarnated through the Veil of Ignorance to gain spiritual experience seeking truth.)

Jesus' true Church, the Divine Love Church (re)started by channeler James Padgett, is fully compatible with the Sasquatch message:

[The True Crucifixion of Jesus Christ: Reconciling Farsight Institute, Padgettites, Sasquatch Message and Yajweh | Cyberthal](https://cyberthal-ghost.nfshost.com/the-true-crucifixion-of-jesus-christ-reconciling-farsight-institute-padgettites-sasquatch-message-and-yajweh/)

Josh McDowell [proved](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/880250.The_New_Evidence_That_Demands_a_Verdict) that Jesus rose from the dead, and that is fact.  But there is more to the story, and I found it, as was my duty.

In the 4 months since I wrote the above proof, I've only become more certain of its conclusions.  For example, I didn't know what to make of the office building full of light beings who witnessed the crucifixion and related events.  Thanks to Padgettite Geoff Cutler and Farsight director Courtney Brown's [book](http://courtneybrown.com/publications/CosmicVoyageByCourtneyBrown.pdf) (Chapter 8: Subspace Helpers), I now know that those are Midwayers, Earth's psychopomps assigned to escort departed souls into their afterlife.  They are light beings who live in a neighboring plane and observe Earthly affairs, especially deaths.

## Salvation and Source

Jesus isn't the messiah, in the sense of ""saving us from our sins"".  The Sasquatch Message makes clear that everyone has to ""save"" himself.  However, Jesus did do something very important and spiritually powerful, of Cosmic significance.  The lower lords seem determined not to let humans learn the truth about it, because it threatens their power over their children:

[An Alternative History of Myth and Magic: Connecting to the third Source | Cyberthal](https://cyberthal-ghost.nfshost.com/my-way-to-pray-to-alldad-connecting-to-the-third-source/)

That's why I want Christians to hear that they should connect with the real Source, instead of praying to the angry false god Jehovah, who will poison their souls with hate.  There is no hate in God, only Love.  By connecting my breathing and heartbeat with the suncrossⴲ, I can feel a connection to God's Love.  This seems to fulfill my purpose as a human.  The method doesn't matter, only the result!

Jesus makes this clear in Courtney's book, in chapters 15 and 18.  In the same chapters, Jesus also displays the Masterful authority that the Padgettites assign to him, commanding us to love our ET brothers, even the seemingly worst, the Menacing Grays, as Yajweh calls them.  He commands humans to work with our ET brothers, to save our species and to help the xenos in their own journey towards God.  (Receiving an authoritative command was very unusual for Courtney, an experienced remote viewer.  This was a subtle corroboration, similar to Sasquatch's use of the phrase Padgettite phrase ""Divine Love"", which occurs only in the passage about Jesus.)

There are many tributaries but one River.  The suncrossⴲ is an ancient symbol of God that unifies the old and the new, as this shamanistic music video by OMNIA depicts:

[OMNIA (Official) - Suck my Flute | YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSrL7iGSvUg)

## Damnation and Void

Does God's Love mean evil goes unpunished?  God forbid!  The laws of God's Cosmos are perfect.  Each soul eventually experiences the consequences of his karma and dharma.  It is built into the nature of our immortal souls, and inescapable.  Our aura reflects who we are, because it IS who we are.  In this way, the truth eventually sets even the worst sinner free.

Do not be offended, ye fire and brimstone types:  God has not gone soft!  The suffering of the Earth's hells is beyond all human imagination.  Yet even damnation may be a greater mercy than the numbness of those wicked who avoid facing their karma, growing blacker by the century, sinking deeper into the Void.

The concept of temporary dualism is central to the Law of One, which is partly disinfo but contains much truth.  Even the darkest of Negative practitioners eventually enters increasing isolation, as they reduce their predation on others, to avoid the harmful spiritual consequences thereof.  They cease to war and instead focus on self-love, meditating to seek the Source of all strength, God.  Then, when they are totally isolated and can advance no further, they finally learn how to love others.  This repentance occurs at spiritual densities beyond our comprehension, in the realm of seraphim, but it occurs nonetheless!  Even for the demons of the Void, there is no way forward except back to God.

Whether to continue descending or begin ascending is up to you.  Just be honest about where you're at.  Don't try to skip stairs.  You can't fool your aura or outrun your shadow ☯.  Eternity is a marathon.

It took me a year to purge myself of Jehovah's poison, the jealous genocider who forsook his son on the cross.  Up till then, my life was largely misspent due to heartsickness caused by poisonous blasphemy.  I am very happy to be rid of it.

The real Cosmos is infinite orders of magnitude larger than that cramped and bloodthirsty book — which commands the killing of children, the burning of slutty priest's daughters, and other reptilian notions considered barbaric in the greater galaxy.  That especially includes the homicidal attitude towards ""witches"", AKA those with psionic powers of any kind.  That is a very obvious method of restricting access to outside information, which is a classic tactic of the insecure deceiver.  Does anyone think [Matt Fraser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF7g0d4VSYQ) should be executed?  Seriously?

The people in the [Divine Love Sanctuary Fellowship Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GodsDivineLove/) are very nice, and show that the real Church is alive and well on Earth, although mostly in the Spirit Spheres.  Which makes sense, because Jesus said his kingdom is not of this world.

## Conclusion

I encourage skeptical investigators to attempt to disprove the Padgettite message, by which I mean finding some factual or logical contradiction that discredits the sources.  Appeals to mainstream physics models that cannot explain unidentified transmedium craft utilizing apparent Alcubierre drives do not count.  Probably the easiest way to verify the existence of the ""paranormal"" is to visit a ""haunted house"" and/or use the [Quantum Paranormal](http://quantum-paranormal.co.uk) protocol to call a sphere.  Or just spend time staring at the sky, looking for an aerodynamically-impossible flight pattern.  Or visit the many subreddits where the luxury of ignorance is already dispelled by evidence linked in the sidebar.

I was particularly impressed by the mid-tarsal break in the heavyweight hominoid stride of the [Patterson-Gimlin bigfoot film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjhhFj3Vua0).  Sasquatch staged that shot, not humans.  She is blurry or invisible when she wants to be, and leaves footprints in our plane only by choice.  Otherwise she would be no harder to hunt than a bear.  Yes, she:  Those are the biggest furry tits you've ever seen.  Baby's got back.  That ain't no man in a suit, it's a lady!

I noticed some translations don’t mention divination. 

This includes the Hebrew Bible. 

The English translations of this verse all throw in divination and cdpv even throws in dream interpretation

This verse always confused me because the definition of divination is to recieve an answer by supernatural means. 

This means casting lots, Gideon using fabric, and dream interpretation are all forms of divination 

Society hasn’t denied these things and neither has TheBibleDictionary.com 

Only the majority of western Christians have and from my understanding, for the Sake of upholding our anti-divination reputation 

**back to my question** 

[Deuteronomy 18:11](https://biblehub.com/text/deuteronomy/18-11.htm) essentially says 

No mediums, spiritism , or raising up the dead 

Aren’t all three of these things the same? 

Some English translations add in “necromancers” which is just another way to say one who inquires of the dead

Verse 10 says 

A witch, soothsayer, sorcerer,and (when we flip to verse 11^^^^^) one who conjures up spells 

The word soothsayer (from my dictionary) is another word for prophet.  Later in Deuteronomy 18 were taught how to discern between false/pagan prophets and God’s prophets 

By definition, aren’t these things all one and the same?

(Especially if you’re a believer who is skeptical about my theory that witchcraft was probably defined differently in B.C and today)",Deuteronomy 18:10.

63,"Some time ago, I did a meditation session with a teacher, this was one of those sessions to get a blessing and the right to practice what he taught us in the future. (sorry for my English)

Within the session, I saw myself as a white fox with black mouth in the inside. As a fox I saw a lotus, and from my mouth snakes would come out and vanish around it, purifying it. I also saw a white being and colors, white and black were included and black kept appearing during the rest of the session.
Right after I saw these things the teacher would tell us to visualize something similar to what I had just seen. Told us to visualize a lotus and how it became purified, and the being we were praying to as a white being, and to visualize the colors of the chakras.

Now, I know this was just by chance, but I'm still curious, does any of what I saw have any symbolic meaning in buddhism? In particular curious about the color black, since I usually see it associated to negative things and it was quite present all the time.

69,"It's all too common, sometimes on this subreddit, as well as subreddit dedicated to each particular religion such as r/islam r/Christianity etc. There's always that one comment where they arrogantly disparage that without belief or fear of their God, or without the acceptance of religious morality, society will become corrupt, violent, degenerate &amp; perverted, whilst also at the same time seem to be completely ignorant to the fact almost every religiously dominated culture &amp; nation such as Middle East, Africa, South &amp; South East Asia &amp; South America have perpetually been the most war-ridden, corrupt, violent, poverty-stricken &amp; oppressive places on Earth, in comparison to the democratic nations of the West such as those of Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan &amp; South Korea where secularist, humanist &amp; constitutionally-dominating social structure have contributed to them being the most peaceful, productive &amp; prosperous nations on Earth today. There are other nations such as in &amp; around the Indian subcontinent, where Dharmic faith, and not Abrahamic ones, are most socially dominant, however, these nations also face constant corruptions, violence, wars, poverty &amp; oppressions for all too similar reasons. 

I have been rebutted many times, with Abrahamic theists claiming the terrible state of these nations have nothing to do with religion, claiming my correlations do not link to causation, of which I strongly disagree. After some thinking &amp; research, I have identified at *least* 8 points in which religion either directly caused or contributed to these nations being in the terrible state as they are:

 **A: Tribalism**

In the United States, religion perpetuates the social/ideological phenomenon of a 'good vs evil' &amp; 'us vs them; mentality. In issues of leadership &amp; governance, the people are much more socially inclined to elect or vote for a leadership system based on religious belief, gender, skin color, economic class and social caste first and foremost, instead of electing a leadership system based on a traits of competency, experience and merit. This phenomenon is multiplied five-fold in nations that are much more religiously &amp; socially conservative like those of Middle East, Africa, Asia, South America etc. who constantly end up with corrupt, violent, incompetent &amp; tyrannical dictators at the helms of government, judiciary and the military making bad decisions that screw up the quality of life for people in the country. A person's religious belief &amp; skin color aren't good measures of competency or experience. Religion makes people think like it is. Voting or instilling someone in power who does not share the same faith as you may be akin to voting for the Devil/Satan/Shaytan in some of these countries.

**B: Lack of Human Rights/Democracy**

The moral doctrines of most religions, particularly the most dominant religions in the world like Islam, Christianity have no regards for, or even outright hostile to concepts of Democracy &amp; Human Rights. They believe that concepts of 'Human Rights' &amp; 'Democracy' are merely subjective moral human constructs and take no precedence in regards to the rules &amp; laws already established by their god or faith and thus has less merit, and can be even be disregarded. In addition, the moral doctrines of these religions may also include rules, instructions and glorification that justifies acts of oppression, discrimination, violence, genocides, slavery &amp; war crimes against groups of people their faith may deem 'undesirables' (eg. gays, women, apostates, atheists, Jews, infidels, blasphemer, heretics, liberals etc.) These are all contributing reasons to why religiously dominated nations are always perpetuated with Human Rights problems violence, and/or end up with tyrannical governments compared to nations of the Secular West. Their religious/cultural beliefs justify these morally questionable worldview &amp; actions not only as something socially acceptable, but sometimes even outright a requirement. 

**C: Civil War/Rebellions/Uprisings**

Naturally, Human being's don't like having their rights taken away, oppressed or discriminated against. Throughout history, those who are oppressed would typically respond by taking up arms &amp; fighting back against their oppressors. This is no shortage to the contributing reasons why a highly select number of religiously dominated nations particularly the Middle East, Africa &amp; Asian regions, are always full of civil wars, rebellions, coups, uprisings &amp; violent revolutions. Wars/Civil wars are generally bad for nations since it results in destruction of things that make it prosper, such as infrastructure, roads, bridges, hospitals, schools, power-plants etc. Without these important infrastructures, a nation inevitably descends into poverty. Statistics show close links between rises in poverty with rises in ideological extremism &amp; crime. Its not surprising that religiously dominated countries *also* have elevated statistics of theft, gang association/violence, political corruption, terrorism, homicides, human &amp; drug trafficking etc. compared to the secular West.

**D: Low National Morale, Human Flight &amp; Brain Drain**

With all the previous 3 phenomenon combined, people living in these nations have lower morale &amp; lose hope of any good standard of living. This results in Human Flight &amp; Brain Drain, a phenomenon where all the intelligent people needed to keep the country functioning like scientists, engineers, teachers, doctors, mathematicians &amp; technicians have all packed up &amp; fled the country to take refuge in more peaceful/prosperous nations (i.e the Secular West), taking their knowledge &amp; expertise with them in the process, &amp; leaving their former nation to be weak with nothing. A contributing reason as to why scientific, social, political and technological progress in most third world religiously dominated nations are either low or nonexistent compared to the Secular West.

 **E: Golden Parachute &amp; Martyrdom Glorification**

Many religions promise an positive after-life, maybe one that's without suffering, poverty, violence &amp; all that's good imaginable so long as its rules &amp; tenets are adhered to. Seeing as how complex &amp; difficult social problems within a given religiously dominated country are, people may be less motivate &amp; incentivized to take the proper correct actions to make their own and others, lives better as, even if they fail, there is a lingering belief there's a golden parachute of a happy afterlife waiting for them on the other side that will solve all their mortal problems by default anyway. This is akin to why nothing in the world is free; if everything is free, people become lazy &amp; not have to work &amp; earn it. Some religious beliefs (Christianity, Islam) believe Martyrdom, an act of dying for the advancement of one's own belief, is a guaranteed ticket to heavenly afterlife that shall absolve all their sins in an instant. This may incentivizes believers into putting their lives in extremely risky, precarious and unnecessarily dangerous situations that not only end up harming or killing themselves, but others as well. This is made worse if the person so happened to be a scientist, teacher, engineer, mathematician or doctor. If these important people waste their lives away on a suicide Holy War mission. A dead doctor is no good to anyone.

**F: Virtue Signalling As a Solution To Societal Problems**

As an analogy goes: ""Give a man a fish to eat, he shall be fed for a day, but teach a man to fish for himself, and he shall feed himself for a lifetime"". Religions like Christianity, Islam &amp; but extension even Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism etc. have text that emphasizes mercy &amp; compassion, to give alms &amp; donation to the poor, and to fast at certain times of months or years to better empathize with the poor, but none of their Holy Scriptures contain any realistic instructions on how to solve &amp; prevent poverty &amp; suffering in the first place. None of their texts give instructions or wisdom on how to build roads, hospitals, schools, electricity, how to properly manage an economy, taxation &amp; social services etc. None of them contain any meaningful words of wisdom in regards to science, engineering, technology or mathematics; the essential building blocks all prosperous &amp; productive nations, despite claims these texts were the source of the greatly divine &amp; superior intelligence. It's akin to giving Morphine to a cancer patient then claiming the cancer is gone just because he feels no more pain. The faith's solutions to complex mortal problems is no short of virtue signaling. It's not surprising as to why most religiously dominated countries in general lack, or fall behind in scientific, social, political, economical &amp; technological developments compared to the secular west.

**G: Identifying &amp; Solving Problems Through Logical Fallacies/Unsound Epistemology** 

If you ask any believer the reason for their belief, they will always provide a logically fallacious answer that includes but not limited to, appeal to ignorance fallacy, special pleading, black &amp; white fallacy, appeal to popularity, appeal to time etc. Depending on the faith in question, not only do their texts fail to teach their believers critical thinking skills, some give instructions on how to actively *resist* it. Then later they learn ""apologetics"" which is backwards reasoning: instead of starting with a question and working towards an answer, they start with the answers &amp; work out from there.  If they don't recognize this way of thinking &amp; problem solving is fallacious &amp; incorrect, there's nothing stopping them from using it again to (incorrectly) identify &amp; solve complex social problems within the secular sphere. It's akin to attempting to build a house using an inaccurate measuring tape, it doesn't matter how well or much you make adjustments, the end result is the house ends up becoming wonky, &amp; risks collapsing &amp; harming someone in the process. In short, don't expect those whose worldviews &amp; epistemology that's illogical, unreasonable &amp; irrational to be able to consistently make logical, reasonable &amp; rational decisions in identifying &amp; solving complex problems in an effective or efficient manner. 

**H: Echo Chamber, Arrogance &amp; Pissing Off Too Many People**

Religion tends to always thrive most in societies enclosed societies where the majority everyone shares the same belief. Without input or criticism from outside ideas &amp; views, these beliefs will grow &amp; multiply into echo chambers that may make people overvalue the validity, soundness &amp; merit of said belief, increasing the risk of them making rash, risky or dangerous actions, such as expansion, conquest, terrorism, wars, threats, and assimilation of surrounding lands &amp; peoples who are different to them, or to eliminate them out of intolerance, or to monopolize their belief system. Ultimately if this transgresses enough, the surrounding nations &amp; people who are threatened by this expansion will unite together to fight against a common enemy for their survival, ultimately resulting in the perpetrator nation being overwhelmed, defeated, destroyed &amp; the wills of the victor nations placed upon them (see the fates of: Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, Ottoman Empire, Qing Dynasty, Iraq 2003, Libya 2011). In short, too many people &amp; societies throughout history incorrectly overvalued their beliefs, believing God was on their side to ensure success in all their endeavors, increasingly justifying them to take dangerous, risky &amp; bad decisions. Reality would then place their beliefs in check.

\---

As a secular humanist, I feel insulted by the brashness &amp; arrogance of some theists who make such claims, that homosexuality, alcohol consumption, music, liberalism, secularism, atheism, sexual freedom, gender equality, &amp; 'godlessness' is, or are, causing the downfall of society, despite ignoring the fact that most religiously dominated nations being in the ***already*** terrible state that they are have NOTHING to do with any of those aforementioned phenomenon. If anything, one could make a better argument that it is ***religion*** that caused the downfall of these societies, rather than 'godlessness', 'lewdity' or 'alcohol consumption'. Religion is not always the direct cause but more often than not, they are all contributing factors that end up exacerbating pre-existing problems. Colonialism is a common rebutted excuse, but the reality is, strong nations don't get colonized; only weak nations do. The people within these religious majority nations either as individuals or as a whole, made bad decision that made themselves weak, vulnerable &amp; opened themselves up for invasion &amp; colonization by more powerful actors. 

I'm more insulted by the fact the very same kind of theists who hold these kind of accusations, are the same kind who chose to seek refuge &amp; to live in the good will of the very secular Western nations they disparage as being 'lewd', 'immoral', 'godless' &amp; 'degenerate'.

76,"Hi all, this came to my mind when I (Christian) was responding to a post in r/atheism. Someone claimed ""The core audience of the Bible has always been wantonly credulous **xenophobes**."" 

I admit, I was a little triggered by the xenophobe comment, and pointed out what I see as a bit of hypocrisy there, considering the very uniform make-up of atheists in general, and ended up responding with an admittedly snarky comment (I'm not proud of it) that got me permanently banned from the subreddit: 

""I always think it's so interesting to hear how keen some atheists (extremely white and extremely male) are to attack the 'xenophobes' (read: brown people from the middle east) who wrote Genesis and the Jewish folks and, later on, the Christians (also much more diverse in gender and ethnicity than atheism) who follow that religion. Great work, you must be so proud of your culture (again...very dominated by white men) that you can see how xenophobic those who wrote and follow the Bible are.... ""

I'm not super proud of that comment, and obviously it didn't resonate well with r/atheism, resulting in me being called a nazi, a snowflake, and then (ironically, given the snowflake remark) banned permanently from r/atheism. That's all fine and well within their rights, I understand they want to keep that community very positively focused on atheism, not necessarily questioning. 

My question is: is the dominancy (in the U.S.) of men (67%) and non-hispanic white folks (82%)--both numbers from pew research--an open secret in atheism? Do atheists wrestle with these numbers at all, wondering about the lack of diversity, or is it something that's just accepted as ok and reasonable (not sure the reason)? I never see it discussed, which is a bit surprising given reddit (I think admirably) really has a great ongoing conversation about the importance of diversity, and also probably has higher atheist representation than most places in society.

So again, my key question is: is the lack of diversity in atheism viewed as a problem by atheists? Is it recognized? Is it viewed as something that could or should be better? Are the root causes for that lack of diversity understood?

I think the ""burden of proof"" argument, when used by theists and atheists alike, is a bit...lacking, if that is the correct turn.  Some atheists often use it to bear down on theists by demanding knowledge about their god and the existence of it.  What I've found, though, is that calling upon this argument, be it from either side of the existence debate, is not fair to the individual.  The layman, of which most of us are on this topic, isn't prepared with a 50 page treatise on the existence of god.  This argument can just as easily be employed by someone asking about something in the realm of science.  Just as it is unfair for a religious layman to explain their views (almost all of which, most likely, came from other sources), it is unfair to as a scientific layman to explain the views of theories and laws.  While I recognize this information can be sought after, the average person just doesn't have the knowledge to refute or argue these points, when asked point blank.  


This brings me to my next point: science is not only outside the realm of many individuals, but what is undiscovered is...well, undiscovered.  I'm finding it hard to put this argument into words, but I think science has just as much of a responsibility to show ""truth"" than any religion.  It's also worth noting that many scientists have incorrect views out of ignorance, especially traditionally.  Stuff has even changed as different laws and theories are discovered; traditionally relativity going contrary to Newton's law, or more specifically and on a modern level, there being multiple laws of gravity to explain different situations.

Like being selected for a job for example. If you're a part of a small pool of candidates, you'll find that the other person always gets selected. Even if the pool is just 2 candidates and you're one of them. Even if you've answered all their questions and the job doesn't even require any skills.........they'll always pick the other person. Probably citing reasons like charisma, team player, etc. There's only so much charisma you can fake. 

It's all in the cards. Some people are just destined to make it while others are destined to not make it.

Which brings me to my theory. You can tell who's destined to make it by their physical attractiveness. If they are physically attractive, it means that God likes them (which is why they made them like that). If God likes you, it means you will have success. 

If you are physically unattractive, it means that your fate is already cursed.....which is why you ended up like that in the first place.

Mainstream Christians: I’m not here to start a debate or argue why this is my belief. I’m not here to have people call me false and heretic for believing in this. 

I grew up Catholic and Pentecostal. The belief in Jesus as Son of God — literal sense &amp; being God, are two things I completely disagree with. I believe Jesus was a wonderful Prophet and Messenger of God who preformed miracles and blessings from God on Earth (similar to Muhammad in Islam). I believe Jesus is a miracle from God given to Mary as a virgin birth. I believe Jesus existence was pre-determined in Heaven, and his spirit was already developed prior to being sent into the word (John 3:13, 8:23, 8:58). I do not believe this makes God his literal father.

I simply believe that God decided to give Mary and virgin birth to the Prophet and Messenger who is known as Jesus. I believed he was a man of dignity, honor, respect, and love. I believe he preformed miracles and followed the voice and spirit of God always. I just don’t believe this makes him the literal “Son of God” but more as His’ final messenger and Prophet. As a term of endearment to someone close. Similar to how many African/African-American men say to another, “Son, come help me please.“

I do believe that he was crucified, and resurrected by God, and raised to Heaven on the third day giving him eternal life. I believe he died for our sins and save us per request from God (John 3:17).

I am not interested in Unitarian Universalist. It seems way too liberal &amp; believes in other religions too.

135,"*The purpose of this piece is not to be scientific, rather this is to examine the meaning of the words subjectivity and objectivity, and to explore some of the fundamentals that make up Consciousness. We will leave sciencing to the scientists, and attempt to establish that while the scientific method will forever be our best path towards absolute knowledge of the physical world, this discipline can only serve as a tool towards that end, a tool of Conscious Observation, a tool that serves our own Subjective Human Judgment.*

*Also, it is important to note this piece will not attempt to explore or explain where Being comes from. While it may at times seem like we are attempting to identify a first mover* *or play G-d, the obvious truth is we will never be able to do that nor should we try. Rather, we are creating an abstract model of nascent Consciousness in an attempt to explain the structure of value and its hierarchy within* *our Human condition*

**The true Master of our universe is conscious Being, and that Being is the essence and core of existence itself.**  

**Objective reality is a relational index of shared Subjective experience or it does not exist.**  

Multiple perspectives are required to establish external objective reality, and concepts of Self are established by juxtaposition with external reality, both are the realization of a process continuously emerging as here and now.

**Omnipresence = everywhere at all time, superior to space, time, and physicality.**

Physical reality at a fundamental scale, wave/particle duality and the uncertainty principle, seem to illustrate that nothing exists except as observed. Further, scientific method in our matter of fact physical realm along with plain old common sense dictate that only observations that can be verified by observers are factually true. Let us then attempt to establish a simple precept; an observer is required for reality to exist. This precept or axiom should serve as foundational to understanding reality and underpins the very notion of falsifiability in any possible scenario.

We’ve told ourselves that physicality consists of 3 dimensions and a 4th dimension we’ve labeled spacetime, but is that really the case, or are 3 coordinates simply what is needed by The Observer in order to stabilize and confirm reality?

And by the way, what is spacetime?  
 

Does space consist of dimension, or is that a property of the objects that occupy space? What if there were no objects, would there still be space? Is space a realization of the difference between objects and if so, who is doing the realization?

3 coordinates in relation to each other define the properties of a simple object in isolation, but what of the other characteristics of the object and the objects position relative to ourselves and/or other objects in our universe?   
 

If we cannot verify a thing’s location, can we verify its existence?   
 

What is a dimension anyway other than a perspective or angle of observation? How can anything that can be called a dimension exist without the conscious Observer?  

Could any perspective exist without a knowable relationship to other point(s) of reference, quantified and verified by The Observer?

We should be able to see that its not possible for measurement to exist without The Observer and a preexisting relationships with reference observations.

*Who was the first observer and what was the first reference point?*

Three measurements give us width, depth and breadth of object, but cannot tell us where the object is located unless the use of another set of coordinators provide a relationship to other reference point(s).  

Do we need another measurable relationship to observe and establish time, or would that function be an extension of the coordinates that establish position as is suggested by relativity? Is time simply change relative to the observer?

Is saying time doesn’t exist is like saying The Observer doesn’t exist... they both exist but are impossible to point at objectively as they are references to subjective experience.

If we establish that The Observer serves as the only true reference frame confirming that nothing exists, or at least nothing can be known or confirmed to exist in any way, without The Observer. Does it also establishes that time and spacial position are kinda the same thing, and are always relative to The Observer and some sort of dynamic reference external to the Observer.

Coordinates that establish position in relation to other physical structure are abstractions that can exist separate from an individual observer and form the basis for objective observation. But how can an abstraction exist separate from The Observer? Where is the abstraction before an actual observation is noted?  

Objectivity requires two or more observers and a language or symbolism of communication. It should go without saying that something to observe is also a requirement. Once that something is observed it becomes information, and if it is never observed or noted in some fashion it cannot be said to exist.

“if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it” is a nonsensical scenario, as any conceivable example of a forest would be made up of multiple symbiotic colonies or cultures of biological observers, and at the very least if we can identify something as a forest we have already observed it and with the proper analysis we could determine that sound had effected it physicaly in the past. A more elemental form of this old question might be “can structure exist without an observer” ...and he answer is quite simply no it can not, as at any point or time that structure has been identified it has been observed.  

**Structure cannot exist without the** **Observer, furthermore, structure cannot be verified or said to be relevant in any way unless it is shared with multiple perspectives.**  
 

What are the properties that make up an observer?

The word ‘observe’ means ‘see’ as in using eyesight, but in our reality an observation can be made by any of the senses or even in the abstract as a created or imaginary reference. The one absolute defining property of a knowable observation is the ability to note what has been observed and retain it for future reference, either from a different physical/temporal perspective when there is only one observer, or to relate the observation to another separate observer through language or symbolic communication of some kind. In this way, by comprehending and recalling observation a continuum of knowability, AKA reality, is established. This continuum can be maintained by a single observer recalling what it observed or by multiple perspectives. Perspective can change and therefore multiply within the purview of one observant Being, or, multiple Beings can each form their own perspective and share it with each other through language and symbolism.

\*Observation can be automated with Human technology, but is still not a relevant or knowable observation until an iteration of Being notes it in some fashion. If an automated recording of structure’s events sits untended for a million years it still does not functionally exists until the results of the automated process have been observed by an iteration of Being, and until then is irrelevant to the continuum and functionally nonexistent

In the unfortunate cat experiment we know of the cat and its entrapment, as these things have been observed during the setup. What we don’t know is what state the cat is in, and we never will unless the cat is observed.

If an iteration of Being were to know something and never share that knowledge with another iteration that knowledge would be lost to the relevant continuum that other iterations of Being exist in and therefore the knowledge would not exist.

If you are reading this page you are an observer. If you had never seen this page you could only know of its existence if somebody else had seen it and informed you of its existence and at least a brief description of its content to provide identity. If nobody had ever seen this page then there would be no one to tell of its existence and no reason to suspect that it exists. This also applies in the electronic realm of cyberspace where the page doesn't really exist in a physical sense, its only tangible embodiment being that of a virtual page that can be shared with other observers… still, it is a page or body of text conveying ideas... anyone who sees it would likely agree with that elemental description of what you are reading right now.

And of course cyberspace is the result of a continuum of conscious agents manipulating physicality and applied abstraction. This continuum existing only because Human agents can build structure based on shared abstractions.

Seems simple, almost too simple to mention, but it is easy to get lost in the faulty mythos of an impossible first moverless Self-denying train of though if we ignore the simple truth that an observer is required before anything can exist or at least can be proven to exists. This is a fundamental conundrum of existence elemental to scientific method and to any degree of conscious realization. This basic truth is at the very core of falsifiability and reality itself.

Of course in actual practice the observer requires properties. In factual terms the only Observer we can know is a biological being in a body using its senses and its conscious brain to observe and remember. But in the abstract, as a thought experiment, can we separate Being from body and conceive of something like incorporeal Being?

Lets try floating within an idea, sort of an elemental theory of mind.  

In mathematical terms can we think of embodied conscious Being as 1 (or any other real number) and  think of incorporeal Being as 0? Zero as an abstract placeholder for potential, the one and only “empty set”? Zero as omnipresence of Being abstractly separate from any specific embodiment of Being or physicality? Something like a vacuum of space that isn’t really a vacuum at all, but more accurately should be thought of as a representation of absolute potential.

A point in space can be specified by coordinates. But who can do this? From the perspective of the conscious observer (*redundant phrasing… how can an observer not be conscious and how can consciousness not observe something, if only the Self)* the point can be maintained in-situ with only a conscious note of observation.  

*""If you could get rid of yourself just once, the secret of secrets would open to you. The face of the unknown, hidden beyond the universe would appear on the mirror of your perception"" \~Rumi*

What if our observer had made no references points of any kind as of yet, just the potential to observe without having observed. A body in space, or better still for this inquiry just the awareness of an observer without a body, because any kind of physical form would necessarily embody observable reference points and we haven’t gotten that far yet, so lets imagine if we can a disembodied observer. Let’s give our experimental observer imagination, because that's how our own consciousness awareness works and it’s the only kind of conscious awareness we know anything about.  

Yes, we are modeling this imaginary observer after ourselves simply because we know that we are and that we observe, and that is the only form of observation we can verify in any way, at least in any way that is relevant to our experiment.

So our observer is in something like free fall, or more accurately is existing bodiless in a vacuum. She/He is (They are) awareness without any frame of reference whatsoever, just the potential to observe and note what is observed, even the potential to imagine something. *(Not necessarily something separate or outside of self because for awareness in a vacuum* *without a body, what is inside or outside of self?)* Just awareness with memory and imagination… ‘things’ we know exist because we have them or we are them, even if in our case these properties seem dependent on our physical bodies, and the ability to prove them to any other perspective or iteration of awareness is completely dependent on our bodies and the corporeal ability to express our observations and thoughts through speech or writing or shared symbolism of some kind… but, we’re going to continue this experiment by considering the abstract potential of awareness without yet physical existence because we have a point to make.

In order to clarify our discussion going further, lets assign a name to this incorporeal awareness with imagination and memory, since we’ve already touched on the properties of zero as absolute potential, lets call this incorporeal observer Zero.

So Zero ‘exists’ (They think therefore They am) even though Zero doesn't really know what existence is. Zero doesn't really know what anything is because They exist in a void and have experienced nothing and made no observations.

Zero thinks, or has the potential to think, therefore Zero is. That is all that can be said about Zero at this stage of our inquiry.

Zero is unsure of everything or anything because Zero has no frame of reference whatsoever. Zero cannot even be absolutely sure of Self within these conditions. How can Zero be sure of anything, because there literally is no thing. Nothing to compare Self to and existing in conditions that don’t allow any kind of meaningful measurement because there is no-thing to measure and no method of measurement.  
 

What now?

What if Zero saw or experienced or maybe imagined/created something? Of course, in His/Her present state of Being, bodiless, and without knowledge of literally anything, the thing that Zero imagined would likely be pretty simple. What qualities could this new thing possibly posses and furthermore, how could Zero understand or describe those properties even to his/herself?  

Any description of anything requires predetermined labels or metrics based entirely on past observations and measurements of other things. If we had never seen anything before we would have no way of describing the first thing we saw. Every element of objective understanding and communication involves a comparison or juxtaposition with something already understood. Even purely subjective communication relies on metaphoric references to, and comparisons with, objectively knowable things.  

Anyway, Zero is Being with the power to imagine or create, and in a state of something like loneliness and boredom or just to get things started imagines a thing within Their purview. A simple thing of course, because extended properties do not yet exist. What is a thing without any properties other than existence? A point, an identifiable reference, a thing with no area, no width or depth nor any relative qualities like heat or velocity. Sort of like the point of a pin, without the rest of the pin.

An observation of a point in space. One observer and one mathematically describable element. Would this formula work? Could our Zero hero understand anything about this point in space? What would there be to understand? Would this isolated reference point have meaning or value?

*Lets leave our Zero hero story for a moment and consider things from our present perspective that consists of billions of observers communing with Self and other, and an infinitely uncountable continuum of things observed. We use language as a tool to describe our world and the things in it, and this ordinarily serves us well. But have we ever repeated a word until it becomes meaningless? Just about any word, with enough isolated repetition by a speaker, seems to lose meaning and become nonsensical to that speaker. This occurs to the degree that the speaker begins to doubt that the word in question is even a real word and not just some unintelligible blabber. This phenomena has been labeled ‘semantic satiation’*

*Semantic satiation would seem to show that meaning cannot exist in isolation. Almost as if we need relationships to exist between things or even just the words we use to label things in order to grasp and maintain meaning.*

*Anyway, back to our story*

So Zero has something to consider, but only the one thing.  This is not only boring, it stops making sense very quickly as Zero has nothing else to compare the thing to and no way to define its qualities or judge its value.  They’re still uncertain of self and the more the point is considered, the less important it seems to be.

How can one angel dance on the head of one pin? In this scenario the angel can’t even jump up and down on the reference point because we haven't yet established up and down.  

Next, by chance or by design, Zero observes or imagines a second point within purview, this one is the same thing except its not the same one. There are now two points to observe and a simple relationship between the two things can be considered. Now as Zero studies one thing the other thing is also a part of the consideration if only because what is different about one thing is that it is definitely not the other thing.

These two things are more satisfying for Zero than one or none were before. They can now compare or jump back and forth from one to the other and note differences between them, though there isn’t much at this stage of our inquiry. They’re is now starting to realize that not only are the two thing different from each other, neither of them is Zero themself, and this is something good, certainly better than nothing, and leads to imagining more good along with sharpening the sense of self that appreciates what’s good.

The two points are not the same thing, they are separate so there is something like distance between them. It is the only distance between things in the whole universe so They can’t yet gauge it in any way except to know its the distance that is… though they can’t really solidify the idea of distance, yet, They will only truly understand this idea when They’ve ‘seen’ things from more perspectives.  

But observing is still not so satisfying for Zero in this nascent universe of two things and theyownself. As Zero goes back and forth between them studying one from the perspective presented when considering the other they find their thoughts quickly become repetitious and again kind of boring. Something new might be good *(Zero will always think* *like this, no matter what)* 

Maybe another point would make things better, so They imagine this and make it so.

Now we have an observer considering a universe containing three reference points. Each reference point can be juxtaposed with two others greatly solidifying their individual value. The qualities and definitions, even the factual existence of each reference point become more knowable because each one is defined by multiple relationships with other reference points. Though Zero doesn’t know anything about language or words yet they realize that the three things put together are sort of another thing altogether, what we might call structure or information. At this ‘time’ these three points are the whole external universe that Zero exists in  

Zero still doesn’t really understand distance though… the only thing that exists are the three points and Zero is bodyless so there would be no such thing as moving away from it or even somewhere else to go, besides how would a disembodied consciousness propel themselves? ...it seems better to think of Zero as omnipresent in this universe, and the more They knew about the three point structure the ‘closer’  They would be to it, and the only way to distance themselves from it would be to stop considering it, even to the point of imagining it gone.

Zero then creates or realizes another conscious perspective and judges it to be valid (good/lovable), now Zero becomes truly self-aware in a way that even we can understand. This means Zero has to come up with some kind of label or name for the other mind or perspective and a label for the observed structure and its elements. As with anything else, these names or labels must be shared among perspectives to create verifiable/meaningful existence.

As we said earlier, existence requires a perceiver and something to perceive, while verifiable (objective) existence requires perception shared between multiple perspectives.   
 

So Zero considers something stable, but with an unceasing will to understand more clearly They must consider it from multiple differing positions. Now existing as conscious reflection of physicality, AKA Self, Zero understands that nothing can be grasped in a meaningful way without triangulation at minimum. As Zero wonders what it would be like to understand a different perspective they place themself in that position and contemplate the observable structure from there. Zero then moves to or imagines another perspective and repeats the actions from the new position. As They remember the structure from one perspective They can recall other perspectives simultaneously to foment a stable understanding of the thing that is outside of or is actionable/considerable separate from Thereself.  
 

Either at least two Beings have to exist or our one Being has to be able to create and maintain at least two observational perspectives in order to identify anything and verify that identity, and even then two isn’t enough, much like physical structure, identity, the foundation of shareable reality, appears singular and repetitious when one of only two references is considered from the perspective of the other. Identity only becomes objectively stable with at least three identifiable elements viewed from multiple perspectives.  

If only one perspective observes and/or attempts to identify anything that identity is unverified and unfalsifiable. This singular perspective is purely Subjective and cannot survive in any meaningful, useful, or provable way. A singularly unverified observation can only be true to that particular observer  at that particular time because the only way to verify an observation is to note it somehow and share it with another perspective, be it temporally or physically separate.

Two observations can be juxtaposed against each other but judging the value of one observation from only one other lacks depth and stability as each perspective can only consider a single view of other, and this quickly becomes limited. Three separately identifiable perspectives are required for stable reality to exist… and that reality requires three separately identifiable elements.  
 

Objective reality is a relational index of shared Subjective experience.  

Multiple perspectives are required to establish external objective reality, and concepts of Self are established by juxtaposition with external reality, both are the realization of a process continuously emerging as here and Now.

Of course, the only conscious perspective of Being that we can factually know is Our Own, the one borne of the Living Waters of biology.  

Understand that biology has existed for eons prior to Humanity, and all of it is connected together into a grand system that we cannot see the limits of in any knowable direction, neither temporal nor spacial.

Zero uses biology to monitor and maintain existence, and Judgement to know that existence is not only good, but carries with it the potential for more and more good.

151,"I had an interesting ethical discussion with a Religion professor once at my old college. He described his spirituality in a very convoluted way and this is because his own spiritual journey involved him rejecting Christianity, attempting to embrace Buddhism and ultimately coming to a faith of his own he simply described as Christian/ Buddhist humanism. 

Now, setting aside how that may sound to the average person, I’m really getting to the story he told. In his youth (it was, yes, the late 60’s) he attempted to become a Buddhist monk. In Tibet. There, he was actually more or less turned away by the monastery for reasons I found interesting: the monk told him that he needn’t colonize another faith in order to find himself within it. That the faith which was a part of the cultural fabric from which he was born was that faith for a reason- it’s intrinsically tied to his material, cultural, genealogical and spiritual surroundings. If he finds that he objects to certain aspects of it, he should be working towards a greater standard within that faith rather than taking on an identity which is not his own. 

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately because I’ve begun to sort of scratch around at a lack of something spiritual in my life. In my youth, as many did, I abandoned Christianity and sought solace elsewhere, but never really following through, even with Judaism which I explored because my absent father was Jewish. I wonder sometimes if I myself should simply revisit Christianity and approach with new eyes- as someone who understands religion on a more academic, symbolic level.

The story of the founding - usually referred to as the ""First Vision"" - tells of a 14-year-old who believed in a Christian God, studied all the Christian sects he could in a search for the correct one. Ultimately, he felt he could not resolve the question without asking one of the Christian gods, who informed him that none of the sects were corrrect.

Obviously, the truth of the Mormon religion depends on the existence of Jesus. If Jesus doesn't exist, then the Mormon religion must logically also be false.

With some thought, I can answer many questions about the Mormon church in a way that maintains my faith in it.

But my newest question is one I feel inadequate to answer.

Because it's not a question I would know how to answer with an appeal to Mormon scripture or Mormon doctrine or Mormon scholarship or maybe even my personal feelings.

And that question is: Humans believe in a lot of gods. How can I say with any certainty that the ones I believe in actually *exist*? Perhaps the reason I feel my gods exist could be chalked up to psychology, sociology, etc. I feel my gods exist, not because they do exist, but because my parents and church leaders have taught me to feel that way.

But I noticed pretty much everyone else has gotten either very progressive or very right-wing, even theocratic.   


I think perhaps it's a response to rapid secularization globally, but even that I question since Anti-Theists have even gotten polarized, some being very big on social justice and others greatly opposing it.

I've  been practicing and studying Taoism for a year now and the main thing I  understand is that we should flow naturally with the world, meaning we  should do what feels natural to us and not try to swim against the  current. But then what happens when we see injustice in the world?  Furthermore, how can we determine something to be unjust?

The  first argument could be that if it feels natural for me to fight  against something I see as unjust, then I should do it. But then  couldn't the person acting unjustly feel like these actions are natural  to them and therefore would be their Tao? Wouldn't I be going against  the Tao by going against their actions? I feel like there are many  readings in Taoism in which we should act apathetic against injustice or  not consider anything to be right or wrong in the first place.

196,"List from [here](https://www.clearhat.org/blog/post/god-is-an-infinite-sphere-the-center-of-which-is-everywhere-the-circumference-nowhere):

1. ""The substance of God is spherical, in no way resembling man. He is all eye and all ear, but does not breathe; he is the totality of mind and thought, and is eternal."" -- Diogenes Laertius, talking about what Xenophanes believed in *Lives of Eminent Philosophers*. Xenophanes lived 570-478 BC. Although Xenophanes is generally believed the first to talk about God as a sphere, the idea may go back even further: ""It is said that \[Musaeus\], the son of Eumolpus, was the first to compose a genealogy of the gods and to construct a sphere, and that he maintained that all things proceed from unity and are resolved again into unity."" -- Diogenes Laertius, talking about Musaeus in *Lives of Eminent Philosophers*. It is unknown when Musaeus lived, maybe 700 BC or older.
2. ""Empedocles quoque sic Deum diffinire fertur: Deus est sphaera cujus centraum ubique, circumferentia nusquam."" (""Empedocles defined God as follows: 'God is a sphere whose center is everywhere, circumference nowhere.'"") Vincent de Beauvais, *Speculum historiale* (ca. 1190-1264). This is the first clear reference to the idea, but it is not yet clear where Beauvais got this quote. I first found reference to this quote in *Nietzsche and a Platonist Tradition of the Cosmos: Center Everywhere and Circumference Nowhere* [by Robin Small](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709306). Empedocles lived c. 494-434 BC
3. ""...a few years after he died, the Sicilian Empedocles of Agrigentum plotted a laborious cosmogony, in one section of which the particles of earth, air, fire, and water compose an endless sphere, 'the round Sphairos, which rejoices in its circular solitude.'"" -- Jorge Luis Borges, *Pascal's Sphere*. Also quoted by Borges, but missing the ""infinite"" aspect, is Parmenides: ""Being is like the mass of a well-rounded sphere, whose force is constant from the center in any direction."" -- Parmenides of Elea. Parmenides lived around 515 BC, but only a few fragments of his writings exist, so speculation is heavy with this one. On a related note, Permenides is known to be the oldest reference to the sphericity of the earth.
4. ""The soul is not a circle in the sense of the geometric figure but in that it at once contains the Primal Nature as centre and is contained by it as circumference \[... We\] hold through our own centre to the centre of all the centres, just as the centres of the great circles of a sphere coincide with that of the sphere to which all belong."" -- Plotinus, 3rd Century
5. (The following quote is regarding examples of the close relationship between Plotinus' ideas and Marius Victorinus (4th Century). Victorinus is believed by some to be the original author of the 'infinite sphere' phrase): ""I shall mention only one, the geometrical comparison of centre and sphere of which Plotinus is so fond and which appears at least twice in the *Adversus Arium* \-- applied to the Trinity first in its inner life (i. 6), and then in its relation to the world at large. The point or centre gives birth, as it were, to both line (radius) and sphere. Victorinus insists that we should imagine a tridimensional and ever-moving sphere rather than a flat motionless circumference. The centre (i.e. the Father), having no dimensions, is perfectly still, but dynamically present in each moment and movement of the line and sphere which it generates and which revolve around it (Son and Spirit are *magis motus*); the centre is thus to some extent the whole sphere. Around this divine reality revolves the cosmos, which is not a perfect sphere but some approximate imitation."" -- Henry, P. (1950). *The Adversus Arium of Marius Victorinus, The First Systematic Exposition of the Doctrine of the Trinity*. The Journal of Theological Studies
6. ""God is everywhere and nowhere in space."" (In this quote, although there is no reference to the sphere, the description contains the essential paradox, and Emerson later attributes the sphere to Augustine as well, although apparently mistakenly.) -- Augustine, *Confessions*, 354-430 A.D.
7. ""God is an infinite sphere, the center of which is everywhere, the circumference nowhere."" -- [Hermes Trismegistus or possibly Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_24_Philosophers), *Book of the 24 Philosophers*, 12th Century. Marius Victorinus is believed by some to be the author of this book.
8. ""God is an intelligible sphere, whose center is everywhere, and whose circumference is nowhere."" -- Alain of Lille, 12th Century
9. ""But it is true without fail that she whose womb swelled understood more than Plato, for she knew from the time that she bore Him and rejoiced in doing so, that He was the wondrous sphere that can have no end, that shoots its center through every place and whose circumference has no fixed place. She knew that He was the wondrous triangle whose unity creates three angles, but whose three angles make only one whole. He is the triangular circle, the circular triangle who harbored in the virgin. Plato did not know as much as that; he did not see that the triple unity in this simple trinity, the sovereign deity clothed in a human skin, is God who is called Creator."" -- *The Romance of the Rose*, Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun, 1230-1275
10. ""With his whole being God is present whole and entire as much in the least thing as in the greatest. Thus the just person who loves God in all things would seek in vain for something more or greater when he has some little thing in which the God whom he loves alone to the exclusion of everything else is totally present. There is no 'greater' or 'less' in God nor in the One; they are below and outside God and the One. And thus someone who sees, seeks, and loves what is more or less is not as such divine. This is the meaning of the axiom in the *Book of Twenty-Four Philosophers*: 'God is the infinite intellectual sphere with as many circumferences as centers and whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere. He is entire in his least part.'"" -- Meister Eckhart (1260-1328), *Commentary on Exodus* n. 91, Chapter t6, verse 18 (LWII 94, a7-95); translated in Meister Eckhart: Teacher and Preacher, ed. and trans. Bernard McGinn with the collaboration of Frank Tobin
11. ""In its depths I saw internalized, bound with love in one volume, what through the universe becomes unsewn quires: substances and accidents and their modes as it were conflated together, in such away that what I describe is a simple light... In that Light one becomes such that it is impossible ever to consent to turn away from it toward any other sight, because goodness, the object of the will, is all gathered there, and what is perfect there falls short elsewhere... In the profound and clear Subsistence of the deep Light I saw three circles, of three colors and of one circumference, and one seemed refected from the other like a rainbow from a rainbow, and the third seemed fire breathing equally from both."" -- Dante, *Paradiso*, Canto 33, 1300
12. ""By God's power, presence, and essence, God is the One whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere. God exists uncircumscribed in everything. God is, therefore, all inclusive. God is the essence of everything. God is most perfect and immense: within all things, but not enclosed; outside all things, but not excluded; above all things, but not aloof; below all things, but not debased. Finally, therefore, this God is all in all…. Consequently, from him, through him and in him, all things exist."" -- St. Bonaventure, 13th Century
13. ""God is an infinite circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere."" -- Nicholas of Cusa (1401 – 1464)
14. ""Thus God is the center of all, because He is so in all things that He is more internal to each thing than it is to itself. He is also the world's circumference because, in existing outside all things, He so transcends all things that His dignity immeasurably excels the highest summit of each thing. Again, He is greatest of all in power to the extent He is least of all in quantity, if this is permissable way of putting it. As He is the center, He is in all, but as the circumference, He is outside all; in all, but not included because He is also the circumference; outside all too but not excluded because He is also the center. So what is God? One might call Him a spiritual circle whose center is everywhere, whose circumference is nowhere."" -- Marsilio Ficino, *Platonic Theology,* XVII, 3. 15th Century
15. ""Now, my friends, you may depart, and may that intellectual sphere whose centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere, whom we call GOD, keep you in his almighty protection."" -- *Gargantua and Pantagruel*, Francois Rabelais, 16th Century
16. ""Our soul delighteth to disport itself and is well pleased in that frolic to take a review of its native country, which is the heavens, where it receiveth a most notable participation of its first beginning with an imbuement from its divine source, and in contemplation of that infinite and intellectual sphere, whereof the centre is everywhere, and the circumference in no place of the universal world, to wit, God."" -- *Gargantua and Pantagruel*, by Francois Rabelais, 16th Century
17. ""We can state with certainty that the universe is all center, or that the center of the universe is everywhere and the circumference nowhere."" -- Giordano Bruno, 1584
18. ""The whole visible world is only an imperceptible atom in the ample bosom of nature. No idea approaches it. We may enlarge our conceptions beyond all imaginable space; we only produce atoms in comparison with the reality of things. It is an infinite sphere, the center of which is everywhere, the circumference nowhere. In short, it is the greatest sensible mark of the almighty power of God that imagination loses itself in that thought."" -- Pascal, 1600s
19. ""We naturally think ourselves much more capable of reaching the center of for the visible expanse of the things than of grasping their circumference, world visibly surpasses us; but since it is we who surpass smaller things, we believe ourselves more capable of possessing them. Yet just as great a capacity is needed for reaching the Nothing as the Everything; it must be infinite for both of them, and it seems to me that anyone who had grasped the final principles of things would also have managed to reach the infinite. The one depends on the other, and the one leads to the other. These extremes meet and reunite with each other just because of their distance apart; they rediscover each other in God and in God alone."" -- Pascal, Pensees, 129.
20. ""O God, thou art an intelligible sphere, whose centre is everywhere, whose circumference is nowhere but in thyself."" -- Joseph Hall, sermon, 1600s
21. ""God is a sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere."" *The Blessed and Boundless God*, George Swinnock, 1600s
22. ""Let him ask Truth herself where she is.... She will tell him, that if he climb into heaven she is there, and that if he go down to hell, she is there also. And that if he take the wings of the morning, and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there also he shall meet with her, and can never go out of her sphere, whose center is every where, and whose circumference is no where."" -- John Norris, *An Essay towards the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World*, (London, 1701)
23. ""God is that Sacred Circle of All-Being, of Infiniteness, of Eternity, whose Center is everywhere, in the smallest Point of Things; whose Circumference is no where bounded."" -- Peter Sterry, *The Appearance of God to man*, 1710
24. ""Properly speaking, a mystery is an obviously absurd dogma which nevertheless conceals within itself a sublime truth . . . for example when Pascal, who was at the same time pietist, mathematician, and philosopher, says in this threefold capacity that God is everywhere center and nowhere periphery."" -- Schopenhauer, *Parerga and Paralipomena*, II, 334 (Sect. 174), 1851
25. ""The eye is the first circle; the horizon which it forms is the second; and throughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end. It is the highest emblem in the cipher of the world. St. Augustine described the nature of God as a circle whose centre was everywhere, and its circumference nowhere."" -- Ralph Waldo Emerson, *Circles*, 1841
26. ""You are a wheel whose substance alone exists, the diameter of the circle without circumference creating a plane by its rotation around its median point. The substance of your diameter is a Point."" -- Alfred Jarry, 1869
27. ""God is the tangential point between zero and infinity."" –- Alfred Jarry, 1898.
28. ""O Zarathustra... to those who think as we do, all things themselves are dancing: they come and offer their hands and laugh and flee and come back. Everything goes, everything comes back; eternally rolls the wheel of being. Everything dies, everything blossoms again; eternally runs the year of being. Everything breaks, everything is joined anew; eternally the same house is being built. Everything parts, everything greets every other thing again; eternally the ring of being remains faithful to itself. In every Now, being begins; round every Here rolls the sphere There. The center is everywhere. Bent is the path of eternity."" -- Friedrich Nietzsche, *Thus Spoke Zarathustra, a Book for All and None* (1884)
29. ""Every center of force has a perspective towards the entire remainder, i.e. its own particular valuation, mode of action, and mode of resistance. The 'apparent world', therefore, is reduced to a specific mode of action on the world, emanating from a center. Now there is no other mode of action whatever; and the 'world' is only a word for the totality of these actions."" -- Nietzsche, *The Will to Power*, 305 (Sect. 567). (Couple this quote with the preceding one by Nietzsche for a more complete idea of what he's saying.)
30. ""The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any hexagon and whose circumference is unattainable."" -- Jorge Luis Borges, 20th Century
31. ""God is an intelligible sphere -- a sphere known to mind, not to the senses -- whose center is everywhere and whose circumference nowhere."" -- Joseph Campbell, *Power of Myth*, 20th Century
32. ""'God is an intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and circumference nowhere.' So we are told in a little twelfth-century book known as *The Book of the Twenty-four Philosophers*. Each of us -- whoever and wherever he may be -- is then the center, and within him, whether he knows it or not, is that Mind at Large, the laws of which are the laws not only of all minds but of all space as well."" -- Joseph Campbell, Myths to Live By (p. 274)
33. ""The center of the world is the axis mundi, the central point the pole around which all revolves. The central point of the world is the point where stillness and movement are together. Movement is time, but stillness is eternity. Realizing how this moment of your life is actually a moment of eternity, and the experiencing the eternal aspect of what you’re doing in the experiences -- this the mythological experience.” -- Joseph Campbell, *Power of Myth*, 20th Century. (related to the preceding entry)
34. ""I had a feeling once about Mathematics, that I saw it all -- Depth beyond depth was revealed to me -- the Byss and the Abyss. I saw, as one might see the transit of Venus -- or even the Lord Mayor's Show, a quantity passing through infinity and changing its sign from plus to minus. I saw exactly how it happened and why the tergiversation was inevitable: and how the one step involved all the others. It was like politics. But it was after dinner and I let it go!"" -- Winston Churchill, *My Early Life*, 1930
35. ""At the center of the universe dwells the Great Spirit. And that center is really everywhere. It is within each of us."" -- Black Elk, 20th Century
36. ""And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must live together like one being. And I saw that the sacred hoop of my people was one of many hoops that made one circle, wide as daylight and as starlight, and in the center grew one mighty flowering tree to shelter all the children of one mother and one father. And I saw that it was holy."" -- Black Elk, 20th Century
37. ""Pascal said that God is a circle, of which the center is everywhere and the circumference nowhere. But how is one to imagine a circle apart from its circumference? The *Zohar* adopts the antithesis of this paradoxical image and in respect of the circle of Pascal would say rather that the circumference is everywhere, while that which is nowhere is the center."" -- Manly P. Hall, *The Secret Teachings of all Ages*, 20th Century

199,"… ***while a circle would say that the divine nature is eminently circular. Thus each would ascribe to God its own attributes, would assume itself to be like God, and look on everything else as ill-shaped.***” - Baruch Spinoza, *Correspondence*, p. 387.

Baruch Spinoza was a seminal thinker of the early Enlightenment period. From early on Spinoza was seen as something of a genius. Growing up in seventeenth century Amsterdam, Spinoza was expected to become a great Rabbi who, through his interactions with the great Christian theologians, would bring more harmony to Jewish-Christian relation. However, his early heretical pronouncements and actions would lead to his excommunication from the Jewish community into which he was born.

Spinoza has variously been described as an atheist, a pantheist, or sometimes as a panentheistic. His view of God’s relation to the world is very different to the Judaeo-Christian view in which God is wholly other and has created the world separate of Himself. Spinoza’s is not a traditional theistic concept of God, his blasphemous notions of divinity were just as offensive to a Christians as it was to Jews. 

In Spinoza’s system of thought God takes a more “Eastern” conception whereby the world is internal to the being of God. Everything that is, is in the being of God; God is the *ground of being*. 

For Spinoza the universe is God or God is the universe, nature is God or God is nature; they are one and the same thing, hence his phrase ‘*deus sive natura*’, ‘god or nature’, to denote the totality of what exists. 

This view is a far cry from the idea that there is a separate transcendent providential deity with intentions and plans for what it has created, which judges and rewards or punishes, and is and does what traditional religious conceptions of deity describe.

Since his time Spinoza’s philosophy has had an incalculable impact of many successive thinkers, perhaps most notably Albert Einstein who greatly admired Spinoza. 

When asked by telegram in 1929 by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein “Do you believe in God?”, Einstein famously responded, “*I believe in Spinoza’s God, who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.*”","“I believe that, if a triangle could speak, it would say, in like manner, that God is eminently triangular …”",religion
200,"If you look at many religions they all seem to be very closely related and when you think about the origin of where that religion originated from then it makes sense, since all these religions originated so close to each other.

I’m not a theologist by the way but I do know all these religions copied each other. Take the first testament of the bible which the Jews believe in, and then you have the second testament of the bible which was written in Greek, ironically 40 years before the testament was written the Greeks believed in Zeus and Hercules. I feel like Jesus was inspired by Hercules, since both of their fathers is God.
Even Muslims acknowledge Jesus existence but believe in Muhammad.
It’s like all these religions copy each other all the time and adjust the religions based on their culture. 

To me religion seems more like culturally enforced program than ideology or Gods guide for us humans to follow. But it isn’t, Gods happy with slavery to continue and for women to marry their rapist but gets angry when you mix milk and meat together or if people use certain materials for clothing.

I believe the reasons are these:

 - God is seen as fair and good, but also often misunderstood. These attributes are often used by media to describe Black people in America... they are good people often victims of prejudice and bad assumptions, while in fact they are just as loving and caring as everyone else.

 - Black people are often considered, or consider themselves, more religious than average.

 - The Devil as an Attractive White Man reflects privilege and whiteness as considered the common attributes of colonialism and oppressors.

 - The Devil as Nihilistic, rather than Evil, just points out that Indifference and Apathy to social ills can be considered evil too.

212,"The Church or any religion in general is useful to give a sense to life and make it easier for us to go trough this journey we call existence but doesn’t mean that they are right or act in the right way, most of the time religions are the pure example of hypocrisy and selfishness, religious people feel statisfied with their lives cause they accepted the fairy tales that have been told them by people that like to give themselves big names, Priests, Monks and so on and believe that living a life of deprivations and telling other people to believe in their symbols is enough to make their Gods happy.

Most of the time they do nothing for others excepts when they want something in return, joining their clubs, if someone isn’t interested in the club then they don’t care, I spent years listening those high religious authorities about helping others and living a simple life while they talk from extreme expensive buildings as much as their furnitures and sculptures, while selling one of those Churches or Temples or Mosque could give food to an entire third world country they prefer to believe that their are doing the word of God.

How many of those religious buildings are close during the night or even the day if no service is made ? Most of them ….. almost all of them and we don’t need to go far away to find poor people, homeless, I live in U.K. and I was born in Italy and in both countries is full of poor human beings and many without a home for the most various reasons, so now we would expect that with so many religious buildings they would have a place to stay in a cold winter night ? No they don’t have it cause they are close, for which reasons ? Safety reasons, safety of what ?

I was in Whitstable for work for a day but spent the day before in Canterbury that is 20 minutes by car, I bought a return ticket from Canterbury thinking that I would get the bus back to London from Whitstable not knowing that National Express stops only where a ticket is purchased so after work waiting to be picked up nobody showed up and it was the last coach, it was 11:30pm, cold and the next available train would depart from Canterbury at 5:30am and no place to stay, it was really cold and I wasn’t prepared so I walked back to the town hopefully to find a place to rest, too late to get an accomodation to spent the night so I thought I could do it like in the old great times when younger I would travel solo and sleep on the street unfortunately no where was warm enough and even if I tried to sleep in the station it was too cold, to keep warm I decided to spent all night walking around and what really upset me was to see all those beautiful expensive churches all close when only one open would save me from the cold I was experiencing but that’s the hypocrisy of most religions, they preach things and most of the time they don’t do it and often they really believe to do the right thing ……. What a fuckt up society we live in, isn’t ? In all those years I found only one Church leaving it open for homeless to have a roof over their head and it was in Edinburgh, one over the thousands I saw over the years, you talk to people and you will hear all the greatest bullshit why a Church keep it close, vandalism, religious items stealing and so on but I thought that a man of God should live in simplicity and attached to nothing so what they are worry about ? They are worry about their hypocrisy challenged that’s the problem.

Until we live in this kind of society doesn’t matter how many religions and religious people we have, our society is doomed to repeat wars and hardships so if you want a change start to change within and when all of us included Priests, Monks and other “spiritual leaders” will begin this process then we won’t need open churches cause we would have solved poverty and mental health related issues.",The power of hypocrisy,religion

220,"Now i know, the title sounds bad but just hear me out a minute.

Let's take Christianity as an example. When someone is Christian, you are told to respect their religion, and to not harass them for being Christian, yet its fine for a Christian to harass someone who is part of the lgbtq community because its ""against their religion"". But being gay isn't a choice, it's they way someone is born. So it makes no sense.

From personal experience, i remember one time there was a video of an injury that a boxer had sustained in the comments I saw someone say ""May allah help them"" or something along the lines. I responded ""You mean the doctors?"" which i got very quickly flamed for saying. But in real life, Allah would have done nothing for that boxer unlike the doctors who would have. Why do people prioritise belief over reality?

In conclusion, why should i be forced to respect a religion/religions that blatantly disrespect and disregard other people and ideas? It just seems very backwards.

226,"As part of sharing my old knowledge of Buddhism from when I used to practice it I am going to share the method in which most monks in China and other parts of Asia that mostly have vegetarian diets cook their meals 

Firstly, all of this food is vegetarian. It is not necessarily vegan however so I don't make that claim that it is. 

Prohibited products usually include:

* Meats and seafood
* Alliums. Garlic, chives, leek, onion, scallion. 
* Cheese and eggs

Almost all meals are prepared using a wok. Carbon steel for stir fries and stainless for soups and noodle dishes. 

The primary cooking oil is peanut oil but this is not the same as refined peanut oil. It has a lovely peanut flavor but it might be unsafe for people who are allergic to peanuts. In that case I would substitute caiziyou (roasted rape seed oil from Sichuan province), or soybean. Canola is not traditional but probably would work it just has basically no flavor and you kind of need a little bit of flavor for certain dishes. 

Most stir fries are handled just like Chinese stir fries for normal food. The only difference is that you have to limit your seasoning to ensure that the food remains reasonably bland; this doesn't mean that the food is tasteless but rather that it's not being overpowered. You are supposed to savor the ingredients that were used to make the food so it would be contradictory to cover them up with say a bunch of chiles. However it's actually pretty common in Sichuan and Guizhou at least to ignore this. 

When prepping the vegetables you do not waste it. Only take off anything that's decayed or rotten, everything including the roots usually gets cooked. 

Again do not waste so leftovers tend to be repurposed into soups. 

Buddhist restaurants exist in China and will regularly mimic meat using various combinations of mushrooms, vegetables and fruit. Everything is usually very delicious. 

Before every meal you do the Heart Sutra prayer and then eat your meal and silence. You don't get your own food but people usually get designated the servers and will serve everybody else first and then eat the leftovers. 

I'll leave you guys with some recipes that I still cook:

Stir fried nappa. Pretty simple just cut the nappa into inch sized squares, stir fry it with peanut oil, white pepper, salt and a bit of sugar. You want the finished product to have a little bit of crunch but not be too soft or hard it should easily give when you bite it 

Stir fried dougan and mild chiles. Cut dougan which is a very firm tofu into thin strips and the chilies into about the same size pieces. Stir fry it until the chiles are fragrant and the dougan was heated through about 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt, sugar and dark soy sauce

Every meal had mantou, a cloud like steamed bread which was amazing but also weird to eat the first couple times because it's very soft and your first instinct is that it might be raw but it's not actually raw. 

If people have any questions on dishes that they might have been served that were of Buddhist origin I can probably give you some insight because I had probably 500+ meals with the monks.

243,"The term secularism traditionally didn't mean 'atheistic', it meant neutral in regards to people's belief systems. Basically, secular meant it was something that meant the same thing to everyone. 

These days though, it seems nothing is secular. Even the term secularism has taken on a completely different meaning. I mean, there's youtubers who identify as secular and anti-religious, despite those two things being completely incompatible. 

I've been thinking about this seeing the rise of Christian movie companies. Before we just had pureflix (now known as pinnacle entertainment, apparently because their streaming service got purchased by another company that didn't want to change the name for some reason), and now we seem to be getting more and more. Pureflix/pinnacle was more about conspiracy theories than religion in all honesty, though they did try to make an actual adaptation of a bible story some years ago. They also made a sports documentary that was apparently actually well-received. Coincidentally, it was also their only movie not trying to preach something. 

This is apparently a booming business, which is why more companies are still coming out. A few are even apparently decent, like Kingdom Story. Now, honestly I don't really have anything against Christian films. My problem is that people seem to think its necessary for a dedicated genre for Christians to exist. Judging by the things they make, they seem to think everything is a religious matter. Even love is a matter of religion to Pinnacle. Before that was seen a secular thing. Everyone experiences love (well, mostly, I am aromantic myself), and everyone's experience of it and ideas on how it should work is the same. Today, even that's not true. Religion is supposed to guide every aspect of your life, regardless of what it is. Whenever you do anything, no matter what it is, you're essentially required to think 'what would Jesus do?' 

Its all rather depressing really, mainly because it comes across as a symptom of our increasingly divided society. I mean, we have companies forming that have to cater their media to specific audiences. Even older media is being forced to take sides in the culture war. Disney for instance got flak for not supporting gay rights, but when they turned coat they got just as much flak for doing so! Its clearly not possible to remain neutral anymore; you have to take a side and constantly make that obvious or else no one will consume your product. 

This all makes me think that there's really no way to be neutral anymore. Or either on one side or you're not. I mean, if you're centrist in anything everyone will assume you're a member of the opposite side. It seems everything, from your politics to how you think a freaking love story should work must be dictated by your religious beliefs (or lack thereof). 

Is there nothing that's neutral anymore? Are we going to start seeing media companies catering to the far-right? Or companies catering to conspiracy theorists (pinnacle already technically does that, though they normally focus exclusively on Evangelical conspiracies). Are we going to see companies catering to flat earthers? Or young earth creationists? To ethnic groups? To the gay community? How far will this go? How divided are we becoming? Its already pretty much impossible to be neutral on anything, how much longer before we have multiple completely different Americas? People have already been saying that there essentially are two Americas. I wouldn't say its completely divided yet though; most people still consume movies from the same companies. So far the only specialist companies we're seeing are Christian ones. How long will that last though? I mean, we do have companies all over pandering to progressives, which many like even though its pretty obvious they're just doing it for the money rather than to redeem themselves. We already got the right setting up their own social media sites, so how long until they start making their own media? What about their own products? Their own cars?

So, in another Reddit post, I had mentioned that my girlfriend is a practicing Pagan, and practices witchcraft, but out of my ignorance (I don't know too much about the religion, only from what I've learned from her), I threw the words ""Wicca"" and ""magick"" in there without really thinking about it. I was informed that ""magick"" was a concept founded by Allister Crowley, and I don't know too much about the guy, but from what I gather, he wasn't a nice person. I'd definitely ask my girlfriend about her take on this, since, like I said, I'm not the brightest when it comes to this topic. She's really into stuff like rituals, tarot, worshipping deities, etc. so I'm not sure where that falls under the religion; as I understand it, Paganism is a broad belief system and can take many different forms. She did tell me that, while it is very, VERY uncommon to see, nationalism exists within Paganism, and she's careful not to step into that territory, but I'm not sure if that has to do with anything. 

I thought of the situation as being somewhat similar to many followers of the Church of Satan; where they follow the religion itself and its tenants, but don't really look up to its founder Anton LaVey as any sort of role model.

Theravada Buddhism is one of the original Sravaka schools, that much is true. However, it developed independently in Sri Lanka for hundreds of years and makes use of texts that were made by Sri Lankan kings and such, so an argument could be made both ways here. In any case it would be a lot like saying that Ford is the original American automaker because it's one of the oldest that has survived but it's not objectively the oldest, for instance Oldsmobile is much older, though no longer around. 

Mahayana is an offshoot of the Sravaka schools that spread into Tibet and through that, into East Asia as a whole. It has its own canon, is far more expansive cosmologically, and has a great diversity in its belief. 

It's incorrect to say that one is more correct than the other because of its birthright. Both are living religions that are changing as time goes on.

Of course there's been Christian persecution of Jews in the past too with a very misguided anger about the killing of Jesus. I say misguided because Paul wrote that he wished he were damned and cut off from God if only his fellow brethren would come to faith - a compassionate expression of love for his countrymen of which Christians should emulate in my estimation. 

So why else have Jews been made to be the villain? I've even had a neighbor before mention to me that ""the Jews run everything"" and he said so with a sneer. 

Maybe some of this is generational - I myself am 37. I don't know why people seem to hold this unique disdain for Jews. It seems to not even be limited to America, but across many places around the world. 

For those of you who are Jewish - do you experience hate from others as a result of being part of Jewish ethnicity, for practicing orthodox Judaism, or for both?

77,"Hey y’all, so I grew up in a non traditional Hispanic catholic household, meaning we believed in God and Jesus and Mary etc.. but my mom never FORCEFULLY made us follow many “rules” that come w being catholic.

For example, we hardly went to church, she is and was a single mother and all so for her to find the time to take care of her kids and work many jobs to make rent while attending church weekly was difficult. She never forced us to pray every night, to fast, or to read the Bible. We did all get baptized and go through our first communions an all that, but I never felt like I was necessarily forced to do anything, I was just taught to believe in God and what comes w that.

Fast forward to my first years of high school (I’m 20 now), I began questioning the existence of God and the trueness of the Bible and all that. I’ve gone through a lot and was going through a lot at the time, and had seen struggle, depression, violence, poverty, and hatred enough times to question the validity of God, Christ, and love in the word. Therefore, I began labeling myself as agnostic.

Still, I’ve always felt like I DO believe in Jesus, for some reason not necessarily God, but I’ve always felt like Jesus is real and watching over me. I don’t know where that feeling comes from and recently I’ve been wanting to build a relationship with him but am afraid I don’t agree with everything that is said in the Bible to truly represent Christ in a good way. 

I’m afraid of feeling constrained, of not being able to do things like get a tattoo or curse or meditate all because I want to acknowledge my desire to have a relationship with Christ, but without my freedom of expression, I’ll feel stuck.

I’m not educated much on religion, I consider myself a more spiritual person.

I don’t believe in Heaven or Hell, but I don’t not believe in it either. I believe in reincarnation, and that people can chose to reincarnate or become spirit guides or rest. 

Obviously I’m aware my beliefs could be wrong in the end, but I’m just hoping to see if anyone can label me or help me understand religion more and my desire for a relationship with Christ. Also, why does God scare me, I’ve always seen him as a scary figure, but Christ I see as warm. I’m not sure where this comes from. But yeah, sorry for the rambles, hopefully this all makes sense to someone lol",Questioning my religion,religion

beyond talking about the process of sacrifice and prayer and how it’s received, this passage points of something fairly important, that humans are born with sin, while the buddha states that we are born suffering, as life is suffering. 

so do these beliefs oppose each other? not really actually, there seems to be a connection through samsara, the idea that unless you achieve enlightenment and break free from suffering, you’ll be reborn into a new life, and vedic religions tend to agree that it is karma (specifically negative actions) that keep you in this life

111,"While it's obvious members of the three Abrahamic religions have and are doing destructive things globally, I do find it highly reductive to blame all religious problems based on just them or exclude them.   


Often there are geopolitical realities and general ethics that predate religion that is involved.   


Hell I grow tired of it, even in media where every catholic priest or Imam is someone evil.   


  
But that doesn't mean there are no valid critiques of Abrahamic religions, there are many, though much more nuanced than the anti-theists running around.   


Like I can honestly see why there are strict views on pre-marital sex and adultery.  


I struggle with Abrahamic views on sexuality.  


  
But the one that really bothers me is suicide.  It has such a harsh punishment in the three major religions in the afterlife. I know Jews don't believe in hell in the traditional sense, but Suicide is viewed as a moral flaw of the person doing it. 

One reason I haven't left Islam and become one of those annoying Ex-Muslims simping for the west is that I do hope there is a hell, that there is some kind of justice in a very unfair and painful world where bad things happen to good people who die alone and in despair, while many evil men die with a full stomach, happy, and often in their sleep of old age.   


But suicide is probably one reason why so many people hate hell and leave Judaism/Christianity/Islam due to the existence of Hell being horrifying to them.   


If people go to hell for having a dick up the bum, yeah hell is problematic.    


And to me, suicide really sticks out as a way to go to hell, because I do see the world and life as ultimately unjust and cruel to those without power, strength, or charisma.  


Obviously, we don't want people to kill themselves, life is sacred and often people who commit suicide are not valuing their own existence as much as they should.   


But the thing is, it's an act of despair.  It's not an act of betrayal like adultery, it's not murder that is hurting someone, and it's not greed. It's not at someone's expense, at least not on purpose.   


Yes suicide leaves people around you hurting, and an argument can be made it's selfish like that, and you leave friends and family reeling.   


But when you come down to it, it's someone that is in so much pain, that they want it to stop. It's an act of desperation, not malice or coldness.   


Where is the justice in it?  It frankly is not justice.  


  
Homophobia in these faiths I can rationalize as the founders having a reflective reaction of disgust at what is viewed as deviant.   


For suicide what was it? That people believe so strongly in God that the founders did not want people killing themselves in droves if they believed hard enough?","As Abrahamic types, how do we deal with suicide and the afterlife?",religion

127,"Let me start this post with a message that I don't have any problem with people who have legitimate criticisms against Islam, I am not Muslim myself. I also have nothing against Muslims and not only really respect your religion but consider myself friendly to Muslims. 

A lot of people who come here on Reddit to criticize Islam have this idea that by poking holes in what they see as inaccuracies or contradictions makes them look good. 

Here's an issue with that. The Qu'ran and Hadith are only officially canon in classical Arabic. Any translation into another language is an alteration of that. As a result it's really easy to have a translation lead you on to a specific interpretation. 

Hadith are simply sayings that are attributed to Muhammad or in a couple of cases I believe the companions. Not only do different schools of Islam have different collections that they refer to when the Qu'ran does not have an answer, but there are specific grades of Hadith (the highest being Sahih) and you also have to fully look at the context of what's being talked about. Studying these things can take years if not decades and this is why there are specific scholarly professions focused on study of Islam and its holy book. It's also why scholars extensively wrote out and shared information which stretches all the way back to the founding of Islam. 

With all this in mind you can't sit there and pick out a passage without understanding the larger context. Often people point to say the chapters on Dhul Qarnayn, from what I understand a mythical character, and about the sun in the muddy spring. A lot of what is written in those chapters is often described as mythological or part history and part embellishment from what I've read. In any case it's not a very strong attack because the name itself refers to him having horns. 

There are numerous other things such as references to diet or washing or where sperm comes from and this is all really not proving anything to Muslims, and as somebody who has had a lot of conversations with these people I really not only feel for how exasperated they probably get over this constant recycling of polemic nonsense, but I also myself get rather irritated at it. 

If you want to criticize Islam I have no problem with it but you should probably educate yourself on the religion some and actually talk to Muslims and ask questions that mean something and rather than interject what you want to say, shut your pie hole and listen for once. You might actually learn something even if it's not something you believe or want to agree with. I found some really interesting insight over my time hanging out in Muslim spaces and I think it's really something that people are not approaching from the right angle. 

This has been a PSA from a non-muslim. My Muslim friends if I got anything wrong feel free to correct me and I will do my best to update this post in a timely manner!",Trying to disprove Islam by pointing out isolated historical inaccuracies or problems with the Qu'ran/Hadith doesn't actually further your arguments.

158,"Just some thoughts I had this evening.  Reply, read, downvote, upvote, I just felt like I needed to write a bit.  To clarify, I identify as an atheist but have a background in western Christianity, and it is the latter that I am primarily referring to in my post, though there are other religions and faiths that draw from some of these principles.  


I would argue many people are familiar with the god of the gaps argument, and anthropologically, I think it portrays in many ways what religion and faith is and why it came to be.  Just for clarity,  I would describe this as someone not knowing or understanding a material/physical concept and therefore saying ""god did it"".  A good modern example of this is the ""irreducible complexity"" argument in young earth creationism, saying the eye couldn't have evolved to it's current state from eye-less creatures.  This alone would be a fun rabbit hole, but I believe ultimately it's a god of the gaps as these believers can't explain something and attribute it for god.  I will now conjecture; I think this is the reason religion was founded.  When early humans saw things like the sun, they didn't understand it like we do now.  It gave warmth, and even over time it was shown to help things like plants grow.  Therefore it was attributed to a god and worshipped as such.  


The god of the gaps argument is seen everywhere in pseudo-scientific young earth creationism, but I see it showing up many other places in religion experience.  I know I've personally dealt with the example of ""isn't the universe amazing?  God must've created it!""  Or someone using their faith to get through a rough time.  ""We can't understand this now, so it must be god's plan""  TO BE CLEAR, I would never judge someone who is grieving for turning to something that may give the situation meaning, even if it is faulty logic.  


Finally, I'd like to touch on the idea of proof.  Far from it for me to demand proof for gods, or particularly the tri-omni god as described by many Christians.  The concept as it is written is not able to be proven.  I think the major point here is that many religious folk CLAIM scientific wonders or miracles (the flood, faith healing, that kind of thing) and that admittedly is where my scientific materialism bent comes in.  Belief is one thing; trying to prove that belief is a whole other thing, and I think so many atheists miss the mark in demanding proof for an unproveable concept, instead of focusing on maintaining scientific standards for everything materialistic, including these miracles.","The god of the gaps argument, how often it's used, and on proof",religion

217,"This is a zero disrespect intended question towards anyone of any faith.  I'm genuinely curious about this and will admit openly to being curious from my own perspective - others can and will differ. 

I was raised Jewish - we were a reform family, so we didn't keep kosher, but I did go to Hebrew school and had to get bar mitzvahed.  Throughout my entire Jewish education, I always felt a bit turned off at how any acts of tzedakah - charity, basically - were almost always directed at bettering only fellow Jews.  e.g. we'd have to do tzedakah for Israel, tzedakah to improve the synagogue, tzedakah to deliver meals to families sitting shiva (a funerary custom, when fellow mourners bring food to the bereft family so they don't have to cook during the first week after someone passes away).  As part of the bar mitzvah/bat mitzvah process, we had to do an act of major tzedakah, which was usually donating some of the money you got as gifts to open an Israel Bond, or donate for tree-planting in Israel, etc.

Setting aside geopolitics and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I always felt that these were a bit self-serving.  I grew up in an affluent suburb, and within 20 minutes' drive is a city where a major percentage of the population lives below the federal poverty line.  It irked me that knowing the history of the Jewish people in Western civilization, our takeaway was not ""help those who need help"" but ""help Jews"". 

I've also been extremely peeved at groups like the Salvation Army and historical acts by the Catholic Church, where charity was tied to accepting dogma or enduring preaching/conversion attempts.  Granted, this has shifted over time from Church policy to be far more inclusive and outreach-oriented, but it's still tied up in dogma.

I've recently been reading up on Sikhi and was gobsmacked by the idea that anyone at all, be they religious or not, Punjabi or not, speaking the same language or not, of a different ethnic/national origin, etc. can come to a gurdwara for food, without the need to demonstrate faith.  Likewise, the idea of religious teachings explicitly saying ""serve others without personal gain"" is a massive breath of fresh air.  

This is more open ended, I guess, but I'm curious as to how Sikhi faith evolved the idea of ""help everyone, and we mean *everyone""* where Christianity and Judaism didn't.  I'm giving Islam the benefit of the doubt in this case given the explicitly stated nature of Zakat and the implicitly stated nature of hospitality, but also because I'm not as exposed to the actual practice and don't want to bring up examples I'm not familiar enough with.  

Is it based on the historic nature of caste discrimination?  Is there a carryover from pre-Sikh custom and tradition that's specific to Punjab/other parts of South Asia?  What made Sikhi be so darn outwardly helpful, and how did it not happen for the first two big Abrahamics?","How did Sikhism evolve meaningful charitable acts as a core principle, when Christianity and Judaism seem to have missed out?",religion

231,"If most people say God is not real and afterlife and so forth are all fake, what do I make of the supernatural experiences I've had in my life? I'm a very logically oriented person and even disbelieved in organized religion at one point, becoming an agnostic. I've had supernatural experiences with two entities, one being good(I believe it is the Abrahamic God), and the other being evil(seems to be Satan). The good entity communicates without speech and without a voice. He connected to me to somewhere in my chest area. And I understood what he was communicating. He hardly ever communicates, in fact it only happened once. And I 'felt' him in outer space, like somewhere close to the Earth but outside of it. 

The other one, the evil entity, is from earth. And I was followed by them during a religious vacation. He had a human form at the time. He claimed that he's a test from God for me, and also was trying to increase my faith in the unseen, as I was agnostic at that point. He was able to off supernatural things on a consecutive basis. He was acting more as how Satan is described in Judaism. It almost seems like he doesn't have complete free-will as humans do and is obligated by God to do some things. This 'person' or whatever is has a Youtube channel and has been making videos discreetly communicating to me through them. This 'entity' claims it is somewhere near the moon or behind it in its spiritual form too. And has tried to convince me its God. At the same it tried to push some 'advanced civilization created humanity roleplaying as God' stuff that I'm not sure I buy. Due to his messages being centered around God of Abraham and Abrahamic faiths. This 'entity' has also claimed its the anti-christ, and it was created for that specific purpose, and doesn't have free will. And that God is using it for the purpose related to me. 

It gave me some serious anxiety in the beginning. The anxiety is now mostly gone. But, I still don't get what that is or what it is about. And it telling me 'God made you for him, and that you won't be for anyone else in life' except for him creeped me out. I don't believe a God has a need like that. I'm going through life normally and don't speak to anyone about this in real life. But I also doubt anyone else but me experienced this. And it's not like anyone can relate to it. 

What I have came out of this with is that there is something or somethings that are supernatural out there. Without a doubt. But it still doesn't fill in gaps. Such as certain qualities about God. Or the question of evil and so forth.

Then it came time to actually share the gospel and make disciples per the great commission in Mattew 28, but I couldn't. I couldnt sucessfully share something even I was uncertain about. I no longer had this enthusiasm for Christianity that I had in the pentacoastal church. I didn't have happiness or joy. I just had frustration, doubt, insecurity, health problems, and spiritual fatigue. And I was just flat out suffering with my own thoughts and questions. Especially with submission and trying not to be in direct disobedience. And I knew I was supposed to suffer because it's part of the gig. God's not interested in my comfort, he's interested in my character. But I've never felt God's joy. I'm just tired? I'm just really exhausted from jumping through hoops to keep myself holy. It feel cruel? Not that I nessesary have to go through it, but EVERY beleiver has to go through it. Like some sick game that has to be played. And yeah, I want that. But it's hard to be holy. You try it sometime.... 

Here are my thoughts:

Christianity starts at the mental and emotional acceptance that you are not worthy, you are flawed, you are sinful, and you need a savior. The good news here is the God you're following sent Jesus to take all the punishment for sin (death) so you don't have to die. So you need to be grateful and humble that you get to have a direct relationship with God and the Holy Sprit as your guidance. If you don't accept youre sinful, you can't accept Christianity, because that's the whole point--someone to save you from your own damnation.

So here's my hangup lately: I right now have no reason to flat out disagree with Chrsitianity, in fact I believe it's the only way to true life.  But I will say, why in the WORLD would God create us with freewill, knowing we'd have a sinful nature, send Jesus to take all the punishment, set a biblical standard for how we should live knowing we still can't control our INNATE sinful behavior (even though some people argue we can be without sin; I don't care you're still going to sin at some point), and yet I'm supposed to feel grateful for something I can't change?

I feel restless knowing I can't be enough. I'm going to experience the terrifying judgement of God one day knowing I tried my best but still failed. (Once again this is the whole reason we need a savior). Sometimes I've wished I could be holy enough and didn't struggle so hard to be that. My sinful nature is what creates the gap, if I could control it I would. So I'm supposed to be grateful because I can't control it? I'd control it if I could!

So enter the whole ""you can't earn it, God loves you, Christianity can't be legalistic you need relationship, it's not all about works, etc"" response. I know all these things.

And im going to suffer too! I'm supposed to suffer if I follow Jesus. I have to give up everything I know and love because it doesn't matter anyways. Yes, I assume God provides for those who love him and submit to his known Will, but I watch people all the time who do that and may or may not be prosperous. Kind of a gamble. Somepeople die of starvation some people have more than they need. And it's all God's plan too because it says he mapped this all out in hopes we might reach out for Him. So I say all that to say this:

1.Why would he punish us when we don't comply...even though he knows we wont? Because we're wired to sin. We can't measure up. And we'll never be good enough without God.

2. Do I actually have free will or not? Did you talk to me before you created me? I dont think that's in the Bible, which means my existence isn't voluntary. I didn't ask to be born with a nature I couldn't control and dissapoint you for eternity and face judgment at the end of my life.

3. If I choose to not follow God,  the penalty is death. No buts no coconuts. So what if I disagree? What if nothing makes sense at all and I don't leave Chrsitianity but I question it too much to follow it?

4. If you listen to ""love God love People"" by Danny Gokey it's like ""OH YEAH DONT MAKE THIS COMPLICATED JUST LOVE GOD LOVE PEOPLE"". This song enrages me. The Bible says what love is. We're supposed to love. I'm sorry, love isn't pleasant (receiving or giving) and drives against the flesh.

Please see the article: [""Hedonism is overrated - to make the best of life there must be pain, says Yale professor](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/23/hedonism-is-overrated-to-make-the-best-of-life-there-must-be-pain-says-yale-professor)"".

Basically, in real life humans come to understand happiness and pleasure in contrast to pain and irritation of all kinds, and happiness and pleasure are more appreciable when we know what it's like to suffer or work hard to earn a state of happiness.

If there was no room for continual growth in 'Heaven', it would eventually stop being meaningful, especially if it goes on for eternity, I suspect.  Even Hell would become less meaningful if it's eternal repetition, though it would still constitute suffering.",The Afterlife and Hedonism,religion

Isfet is ultimate evil, chaos and is considered sin. It’s abuse, violence, chaos, self-destruction, what destroys without leaving anything behind, what hurts AND doesn’t contribute to the ultimate good, and harm that don’t go anywhere. 

A/p/e/p or A/p/o/p/h/i/s,  or more commonly the snake is the agent and being of Isfet (we censor the name because words have power, and it will give the snake power). He is a demon who has no emotions, no heart and will do anything to perpetuate Isfet. He has no free will and is simply programmed to destroy everything that we know. Where and whom he comes from is unknown, but he is not a creation of the Gods. 

The Gods and humans do all in their power to stop A/p/e/p to slow down the perpetuation of Isfet. We humans can help by following Ma’at (a ethical code) and perpetuating good, justice and truth.

Upon research, God is a person in the sense that he feels empathy and can act and react like people, if that makes sense. 

I am not one to believe in astrology and birth signs, but I feel like I fit into the spirituality side vs religious side of believing in God. I believe that religion has sparked fear into people and was used to make people more civilized. I believe more in a personal relationship with God. I don’t think I’d ever go to church.

130,"So the western pantheism states states that universe is a part of God , but if it doesnt exist i would like to make an ajustment . So God in abrahamic belief  is an being of omnipotence , omniscience , eternity .... But the most important one . Complexity . Thats the reason we couldnt rep our mind around his existance and cant understand the motives behind his actions (mostly) . So my ""theory"" is that the MULTIVERSE is a part of God , and just like cells in our body , multiverses are Gods cells , and since Gods complexity is infinite , and multiverse in this case will be composed of infinite universes . Now that we esthablished that i will show some more points that . First of all in the abrahamic religions it says that man was created in Gods image . Now that could be interpreted multiple ways , maybe He designed us on the anatomy level similarly , this belief would also disprove the evil problem that atheists present , the ""if God is omnipotent why dont we live in dreamworld' , and although this is already disproved by mainstream religions , this adds a deeper level , evil is like a sort of virus that inhabits Gods ""body"" , or the balance argument , basicly evil needs to exist for good to exist , also you know that feeling when you have a sudden urge to do something good , or all the good things happening in the world would in this theory be like an immune system counter attack to the virus , also just to be clear im am not 100 % into this , but an intersting theory that could disprove many questions about religion .

165,"To explain what's going on at the moment one has to know first of all the circumstances of Nicaragua, its government and the Roman Catholic Church. Its current president is Daniel Ortega, who has become an authoritarian dictator. But he wasn't always like this. Ortega initially came to power in the late 70s and 80s as part of what was called the Sandinista revolution that overthrew the dictatorship of the Somoza dynasty that had ruled Nicaragua for 43 years. It was brutally repressive regime that tortured, jailed and killed dissidents as well as weaponised sexual violence as a tactic. And it served at the behest of the United Fruit Company which economically exploited much of Latin America.

As a result the Sandinista revolution started which resulted in the overthrow of the Somoza dynasty. A key base of the Sandinista revolution was Liberation theology and the role of what are called the ""Base Communities"". Grassroots networks in Latin America that formed around Bible studies and social justice and that mobilised peasant, mestiso and indigenous communities. Among the famous leaders of this was Fr Ernesto Cardenal, a revolutionary priest, who was key to the Sandinista revolution. The Sandinista's swept to power with Ortega as the movement's president. In reaction they ended up fighting the Contras, a group of brutal right wing death squads that sought to overthrow the Sandinistas. While this happened the Sandinistas pursued successful reforms in education, health care, and women's rights. This, combined with overthrowing the previous dictatorship and battling right wing death squads made them popular and Ortega was initially seen as a liberator.

However since the Contra War Ortega began to take his movement in an authoritarian direction. Which solidified when he returned to power in 2006. Many other supporters of the Sandinista movement have denounced Ortega's turn to authoritarianism and a personal grab for power, chief among them Fr Ernesto Cardenal himself who called it a ""robbery of the revolution"". All of this sets an important background of what has been happening. Since the 2010s, due to government proposals on things like Social security reform, the Ortega government has faced widespread protests. It has been met with police crackdowns and arrests. The Catholic Church was invited as a mediator between the disputed parties. However because of their criticism of the human rights violations they have also become a target. The Nicaraguan government has passed a law that states any entity receiving international funding is a ""foreign agent"". Given the Catholic Church's global reach this law has been weaponised to crack down on them which includes seizing Catholic radio stations, banning processions and the expulsion of the Papal Nuncio.

In the midst of this Bishop Rolando Alvarez has been outspoken in his criticism of the abuses of the Ortega regime in defense of democracy. And his has opened his parishes and Cathedrals in defense of pro democracy supporters who have faced tear gas and bullets at the hands of the Ortega government as well as using Catholic radio to speak to the masses about the human rights abuses taking place. Tensions reached a boiling point when the police barricaded the cathedral of Bishop Alvarez. He was taken and placed under house arrest with his other priests being placed in the notorious El Chipote prison where more than 100 of Ortega's opponents have been locked up. This is just like Oscar Romero used his radio and pulpit to speak to the masses about the abuses of an authoritarian regime, Bishop Alvarez has done so as well. And just like Romero he's paying the price. The seeds of this being laid by Fr Ernesto Cardenal himself who saw Ortega becoming like the very Somoza regime he fought against.",There is a new Oscar Romero in the Roman Catholic Church when it comes to human rights that people should be aware of at the moment.

195,"# 7 Signs of a fragile ego

[https://www.psychmechanics.com/fragile-ego-signs/](https://www.psychmechanics.com/fragile-ego-signs/)

&gt;1. Defensiveness We all get defensive from time to time, and usually for good reasons. But a person with a fragile ego gets defensive unnecessarily. They will overreact to the slightest perceived or honest criticism.

* &amp;#x200B;

&gt;2. Indecision A person with a fragile ego lacks confidence. They struggle to make their own decisions. They constantly seek validation for their ideas, opinions, and decisions. If they’re on the verge of making what they think is a good decision, they may back out at the last moment because someone wasn’t on board with them.

* &amp;#x200B;

&gt;3. Holding grudges When people are hurt by those close to them, they’re likely to get over the hurt quickly. Their ego hardly gets bruised in the process. In contrast, when you hurt someone with a fragile ego, you break the core of who they are. You destroy their whole world. Since their well-maintained ego is everything to them, they won’t forget your mistakes and will bring them up ages later.

* &amp;#x200B;

&gt;4. Unable to handle failure People with fragile egos can’t handle failure and take it harshly.1 They feel worthless if they fail because they think failure brings them down in the eyes of others. The last thing they want.

* &amp;#x200B;

&gt;5. Perfectionism People with fragile egos overcompensate for a weak and inconsistent self by deluding themselves into thinking they’re perfect beings. Beneath the mask of inflated self-image and narcissism lies a weak self-identity.

* &amp;#x200B;

&gt;6. Closed to feedback A person with a fragile ego is closed to negative feedback. They can’t stand it. As a result, they hardly improve. Again, admitting they need improvement would mean they’re less than perfect.

* &amp;#x200B;

&gt;7. Impressing others They jump at every opportunity to impress others. They’ll take on projects they’re unprepared for or will take charge in a situation where they shouldn’t have just so they can impress others.","The Abrahamic God, and the 7 signs of a Fragile Ego",religion

212,"Hi everyone. I was raised in a catholic environment and, since I was little, I've been told sinners go to hell. Nonetheless, I was also told all men have free will. However, if we did have free will, we would be allowed to sin as validly as we are allowed to carry out good deeds without the cohercive factor of going to hell. What I mean is the existence of hell immediately turns our true free will into a conditioned will, being the condition the fear of going to hell for the most pessimistic or the prize of going to Heaven for the most optimistic.

Please note I'm aware Saint Augustine said free will is only exercised when we choose to do good, but as I understand the term, free will is the ability of being able to act as one wishes, independently of other people's free will or if the act performed is good or bad.

235,"Back in my hard atheist days, I was doing a lot of study into neuropsychology, and made an interesting discovery regarding the phenomenology of schizophrenia. One of the hallmarks of schizophrenia is the symptom of “concretization of metaphors”; many schizophrenics lack the ability to mentally process the bundled information contained within metaphors, and default to conceptualizing them literally. The example that I heard from Dr. Robert Sapolsky was that a schizophrenic would hear an expression like, “loose lips sink ships” and conjure up a mental image of giant flapping lips capsizing boats. They can’t access the meaning that is compressed in the image, almost like it is a file that can’t be unzipped.

This phenomenon is not limited to schizophrenics, I would argue. It’s a perennial problem of religion, as religious geniuses are limited by language in expressing the ineffable, and must de facto rely on grasping abstractions to articulate their insights. But the ability to apprehend and manipulate abstractions is actually quite a rare human ability, related to high IQ and high trait openness. This is generally the cognitive domain of artists, scientists, mystics, and theologians. 

In many religions, we see this perennial pattern: someone has a profound insight into the ineffable qualia of reality and attempts to articulate it, using metaphorical language. A community is built around the insights of this figure. Then the apperception of this insight begins to be codified and interpreted literally. In Zen, there is an aphorism that describes this, “when the finger points to the Moon, the imbecile looks at the finger.” 

I believe that this is the reason behind religious injunctions against idolatry, broadly speaking. In Judaism, it was against creating graven images. In Islam, it was against depicting Mohammed. Even in the first few centuries of Buddhism, Siddhartha was not depicted as an icon, but was often depicted as a set of footprints. Because when the mind believes itself to have grasped the transcendent, it reduces it, and it is a known entity, no longer capable of providing revivifying new information. It dams a flowing river into a pond of stagnation.",Metaphorical comprehension in the role of religiosity,religion

246,"One thing that you have to pay attention to is who is defining the narrative. One notices how the narrative surrounding the more controversial topics in early Islamic history are so enthusiastically defined. For example, reading over the description of the events surrounding the banu Qurayza on wikipedia, we see that the vast majority of it is written based on what orientalists have said and accepted. We see, however, only an anecdotal reference to the other perspective from Muslim sources, resigned to the title of ""revisionist"" history. Why is it that this view was defined as ""revisionist"" while the other view has been accepted as the dominant one, despite the fact that the ""revisionist"" view was endorsed by Muslim authorities throughout history?

The popular view among orientalists is that hundreds of men of the Banu Qurayza were executed. Ibn Ishaq was really the only source for this version of the story. However, Arafat relates the testimony of Ibn Hajar, who denounced this version and other accounts from Ibn Ishaq as ""odd tales"" and quoted Malik ibn Anas, a contemporary of Ibn Ishaq, whom he rejected as a ""liar"", an ""impostor"" and for seeking out the Jewish descendants for gathering information about Muhammad's campaign with their forefathers. During Ibn Ishaq's time period, there wasn't really a codified standard by which ahadith could be collected and authenticated to degrees; he was known to collect whatever he could get his hands on. Since his methodology lacked any reliability, his version therefore should also lack reliability. Ahmad argues that only some of the tribe were killed, while some of the fighters were merely enslaved. That being said, there seems to be agreement from most commentators that this was the result of treason from the Banu Qurayza, and therefore the punishment justifiable.",Banu Qurayza ( a Jewish Tribe Supposedly “Beheaded “by Muslims in High Numbers ) and the lies spread by non muslims explained,religion

&gt;!I'm not sure if it's interesting to you, but at least it's interesting to me!&lt;

Coming to the part I want to say :))

Cao Dai followers believe that God is the Creator of the universe and formed religions. Over time, depending on the locality, God has formed different religions to suit the time and place, and is divided into 3 periods with three different branches:

First period: It was the period when the world's religions were formed, including Buddhism, Jainism in India, Taoism, Confucianism in China, and Judaism in the Middle East. During this period, God revealed to his first disciples to preach on his behalf.

2rd period: It was a period of revival of world religions. Cao Dai followers believe that after a period of universal salvation, the teachings taught by God over time have been misinterpreted by the followers and no longer carry His original teachings. Therefore, God once again taught his disciples in all parts of the world, carrying out a revival of the religion. Since then, Mahayana Buddhism, Hinayana Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism, Confucianism, Christianity and Islam were formed. During this period, religions were revived and developed strongly, going beyond national boundaries and gradually spreading to the world.

3rd period: The time when all religions were united into a single religion under the rule of God, controlled by God. 

Cao Dai followers accept other religions and those religions form the Cao Dai religion. They explained that it was God's plan that formed different religions to suit a particular time and place, and Cao Dai religion was ""the only religion established by God at the time of God."" 3rd and final time"" to save sentient beings, no longer distinguishing between religion, ethnicity or anywhere in the world.",Interesting view of Caodaism on other religions,religion

It is no secret new set of progressive values, trans-accepting and pro-LGBT, have risen these last decades, specially on the West.

I've been asking some people here if someone can respect trans people as people, but not accept their claims of being opposite gender. Apparently, you can only be tolerant if you 100% accept transwomen as women and transmen as men, that is the consensus there is no in between or intermediate acceptable view to be considered tolerant, you are either transphobic or you are not. Someone that claimed otherwise was downvoted, and prominent voices such as JK Rowling have been criticized for not fully accepting trans people.

I wonder if meat eaters will soon be considered as anti-environment and anti-nature too in the same way.

114,"At the outset Ill just introduce myself as someone who grew up in a deeply devout Irish Roman Catholic family, then after two years of laborious study and prayer, converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (mormons) and consider myself relatively acquainted with mainstream Christian train of thought. In my immediate circle is a wide breadth of belief, including Eastern Orthodox, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, and lots and lots of atheists.   


As I've attempted to dialogue with serious consideration with other people of belief and especially atheists, people seem to discredit mormonism at the outset, typically starting with the argument that it's claims are absurd, and that the idea of a ""Mormon Scholar"" is an oxymoron because, mormons only base their belief off of warm fuzzies (wrong)! I hear this from fellow Christians as well. I think this phenomena is fascinating because it holds a mirror up to people of faith. 

Mormonism is no more absurd in it's claims than Islam or Christianity, I'd actually argue that theres more tangible evidence to support it given that it's history is recent enough that we have verifiable documented testimonies given by people who went to their death both in and out of the church and never denied their experiences. The resurrection narrative in tradition christianity, while I believe of course it is rational, the evidentiary claims for it rely on inconsistent Gospel records that were written long after the death of Christ and the earliest manuscripts that we have aren't even the ur-texts! If the Book of Mormon is true and its likelihood that it is a product of antiquity greater than not, it would be the single greatest evidence of Jesus Christ and his life and mission that there ever has been. 

I think if you are a religious person and want to seriously engage in productive dialogue with (and without) latter day saints in the scope of mormonism, it would be useful to examine the preconceptions that come with it and why. Consider if the story of Islam's origins happened only 100 years ago, would it have been taken seriously? Or the Resurrection of Christ? If the way people treat Mormonism is any indication, it is doubtful. Antiquity of religion and hundreds of years of scholarship will only be as good as the founding claims. More than anything this is an invitation to treat Latter Day Saints and Mormonism as a belief system seriously, we have a rich theological history and unique perspectives that will aide in the unity and expansion of rational religious thought, but none of that will happen if the status quo remains.",Mormons and silliness - a weird religious double standard,religion

It has elements from christianity and buddhism and fairytales and conspiracy theoris and astrophysics and whatnot). I just want to share a little bit about my faith. Maybe religion is a guide back to love for the ones who are lost without it? If god=love, the story of the fall makes sense. the tree of knowledge was something love said not to do, but you had to take the beit and to know (""curiousity killed the cat"", ""pandora's box""...). Then because love knows all and warned about doing that thing, unsurprisingly the outcome, other then the beit you were offered and immediately got, is.. bad. Then you know good from bad through suffering and loss, and now you can decide whatever, with or without the permission of love, like a god on your own, just like the snake said. but love says you die. Because you are no longer innocent and can't love freely, you can't internally be in this place called heaven. Instead you are on earth. Where you live, stray from love make mistakes and stop living eventually. If I could turn back time I would do what love says. So from now on I will do only what love says=repentance. Love speaks through the conscience. People who don't listen to their conscience cause suffering and suffer ""karma"" and reincarnate and all of this. So that is hell. But people who are seen as their pre-fall version, who are seen for the best in them, and their misdoings as the result of pain, can feel empathy for themselves and others again and go back to love by listening to their conscience (their soul) that is alive again, maybe that is what Jesus does, sees our pain in that way.

Kami-sama possesses the Founder's brother.

Gives his children illnesses.

Says the sun and moon orbit the Earth.

Doesn't seem to know exactly when events occurred in the past.

Tells the Founder kind of random things to do, like to not take a bath.

Am I taking this at face-value, kind of importing this literalistic hermeneutic into a Japanese milieu?

134,"The [Bicameral mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameral_mentality) is a theory that claims that not long ago most, or many, humans were schizophrenic and that was the ""normal"" way of living. Slowly, humans became more integrated and considered those inner voices as themselves, so the modern Ego mind was born. The people that did not integrate those voices were later often Priests or Prophets. It seems the Ego mind is also contagious... it spreads like wildfire.

This explains why the Gods are so important in books like the Iliad and other ancient texts. Gods are mentioned as normally as actual people and kings were.

In the Bible, some experts say that religion basically was born after Cain killed Abel. God got so mad with humanity that now they had to put effort to reach God, while in the past God spoke to everyone normally. This also explains why every age prophets were less and less and people wanted a Messiah so bad. This in a sense seems to be a reflection of the shift from the bicameral mind.

If we are honest with ourselves, the Bicameral people were not really delusional. In a sense, Gods really existed in their nervous systems just as our Ego in ours. They just used their minds different. In a sense, our Ego is also a delusion: We only have one direct god now called the Ego, and it attributes itself retroactively stuff that it really did not do or make or caused. In the past, other entities had other roles in the mind.

If this is true, the Bicameral man basically invented civilization and made the path for humans to develop in every sense. Bicameral mind made the Pyramids, agriculture, hygiene and writing.

In a sense, religion today is still trying to return to that state, but modern religions already accepted the Ego fate and put God a little further away.

I've always found this a bit dangerous, because if these people could be talked into reason, they would probably assume that accepting that the Earth is indeed round would require them to abandon their faith.

As for the verses they cite, I've read that it is true that the people who did write these verses did in fact believe the Earth was flat (as was common in the ancient world). The Bible may not explicitly state it, but it is rather obvious that many of the writers of the bible did believe this.

Also, note that I said 'religious people' and not 'Christians'.

I wouldn't know what other texts may state this, but I do know there's an abnormally high number of moon landing deniers in India due to a verse in some Hindu text that bluntly states that the moon is further from the Earth than the sun is (it even gives an exact measurement of the difference). Also, either way, given that most religious texts have ancient origins, its likely that their writers did also believe the earth is flat just like the ones who wrote the various books of the Abrahamic religions. 

Clearly, Christians never took issue with the 'round earth' theory in the past. Yeah, flat earthers existed in the 19 century, but they didn't rely on bible verses nearly as much as modern flat-earthers do. They mostly just questioned the science behind it, which *was* still in its infancy at the time (in particular, they seemed to question a lot of things about the 'flying earth theory' that hadn't been answered yet). My point is, clearly most Christians don't see the flat earth theory as essential to their faith, so perhaps they should be talking to flat earthers to at least assure them that they wouldn't have to abandon their faith if they accepted the real shape of the earth. Besides, honestly it probably doesn't help that most of the people trying to talk reason into them are obviously bigotted atheists (at least one of whom is also an open white supremacist, lovely). The flat earthers have even managed to convince quite a few atheists that Christianity does in fact require one to believe the earth is flat, giving them yet another insult to throw at Christians. 

Clearly the religious need to be more involved in resolving this issue.",Religious people need to do more to fight the flat-earth movement.,religion
158,"My opinion about religion is that every religion is guiding people to live a good life. Heaven and hell are concepts that exist in our head. If you do bad things, not aligning with the teaching you create hell on earth (for you) but if one follows the teachings he/she will have a good life resulting in heaven on earth.

I believe these teachings are the result of groups of people (hence many different religions) that realized them through time, experience and psychedelics like DMT &amp; mushrooms.

But these truths were lost along the way as religions were used by bad people to create ingroup - outgroup dynamics and gain power through war and conquest.

First I HATE talking about my personal life on the internet but I have nobody to talk to about this. I don't want to make my mom sound like a bad person, she is the best mother every, but sometimes I worry if she isn't being dragged into some bad things.


So my mom has been watching some videos on YT about a religion/philosophy for a while, idk what it is. She has been studying really hard, and buying some stuff too. She tries very hard to talk me into it but I just respectfully say I'm not interested. I don't have the right to tell her what to do or how to think, and I don't want to be an a-hole to her beliefs. But I fear some things are very extreme and aren't really good for her..? Her personality has changed and I can't recognize her.


She has  my father's and mine's mental health saying some things about ""it's our fault"" and that we ""want our spirit to vibrate in those levels"". According to what she says you absolutely CAN'T allow yourself to feel negative emotions because that would change your vibration to negative... but it's so wrong to me. This just makes people feel guilty for being depressed, making everything worse... and on top of that saying it's our fault, isn't it a bit scummy? (Ironically enough, I noticed that she is having frequent rage bursts, more than ever before... keeping those negative feelings bottled up isn't really great, but she can't notice it on herself)


I just had to sit through a movie with her and my family, and she was talking non-stop about the similarities and correlations with what shes studying, and how some secret societies had put those in the movie secretly to mess with us. It was an animation, it's not that deep... on the other hand, she had tried to ""dismistify"" VERY serious attitudes as normal. Even crimes, such as rape and pedophilia, as something ""inherent to human nature"" and ""common"", saying that ""pedophilia isn't just about sex, it also includes abuse, and every family that is abusive in any way is also pedophilic"". That's really fucked up dangerous, abuse is awful but this to me is trying to water down the concept of pedophilia. You can't just say screaming at a kid and raping them are the same thing! And she listen to those opinions and just accept them, never questioning it?! I  had to talk some sense into her and make her see how dangerous , but whenever I try to speak my point she takes out her phone and ignores me...???

This are just examples, but it's just to show how warped and confused she's getting, and I fear this thing is dangerous to her. Whenever someone asks her to stop talking about it, she gets really defensive and says that ""we are just intolerant to the truth"" in a mocking way, or that we are not ""ready yet"". Then I got into a discussion about how she can't just say things and expect everyone to agree with her and want to hear about it all the times. I don't force my religion on anyone, in fact everyone here is part of a different religion and we grew up respecting eachother.


My father is Christian and began following it as well, but I feel it was coerson. He is the best dad in the world, but honestly very easily manipulated and innocent. Still, he isn't as intense about it as my mom. My mom has been very incisive to him specially, which is not at all like her, she was very respectful to other's opinions until she started following this stuff. My brother is an atheist and hating every moment about it. Even though I'm a Catholic we are absolutely in agreement, it's getting out of control and we are worried. 


Anyway, I tried talking to her about it once more. I'm certain I tried my best to be nice about it and not hurt her feelings at all. She started complaining about how she can't speak her beliefs in her own house and that was NOT what I said. I tried to explain that it isn't her beliefs, it's the way she's shoving it everywhere. It's at the lunch table, watching TV, the way she eats, the way she talks, while we are talking about our days, everywhere! Like she wants to brainwash everybody. Talking about literally anything this way would be annoying as hell, so I wasn't trying to go against what she believes but HOW she speaks out it. It didn't work and she acted all censored and oppressed.


Am I being judgmental? Was I too harsh on her? I feel like I did the right thing, but her reaction was really overwhelming and I hate seeing my mother cry. Before someone asks, I want to move out but can't at the moment, and even if I moved out she's still my mom and I would still care about her obviously.",Should I be worried for my mother? Is it bad for me to want my mother to stop shoving her beliefs on everything and everyone?,religion
217,"Hi all.   I'm curious what people might think about this?

For quite some time now.   I've been 'thinking' of the Canadian Charter of Rights.  As kind of a 'modern secular updated' version of the Bible...and the Quran for that matter.   Its written law.   And its based on ethics, of what Canadians think is 'wrong versus right'.   

It dictates practises...and defines our society.

225,"So, I am one good reader who had the pleasure of reading the Satanic Verses by Salman. The book left a deep impression on the young 15 year old me, much deeper than Harry Potter, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, or Sex at Dawn. Yes, I know that at least one of these books will be called a simple kids novel and be dismissed as ""something you cannot take seriously""; but I beg to differ. Every book that is written, is a reflection of its author. Moreso, it is a mirror image of the author's experiences with life and human society being watched under a microscope. So, I had the pleasure of reading the book at the age of 15. What left me speechless wasn't the religious commentary, that was later. It wasn't even the sheer use of language as a medium, because I was an idiot who just loved to read regardless. It was the amount of connect I felt with the feelings of the main character.

The book itself, does not reach into the realm of Blasphemy at all. Why? Because all religion was Blasphemy at one point in time, against a more stable public order or religion. In the end, what won the tussle between ideas is a religion and any new contender becomes the blasphemy. However, the feelings portrayed by the main character of Farishta is one that I thoroughly enjoyed. His journey left me with a heavy heart and a void within. At that age of 15, after reading 10 or so books and feeling this same empty feeling each time, I thought to myself, ""Maybe this is why people turn to religion and idols.""

Later, when I read about the Islam in detail, I had new perspective over the book and its author itself. I then dug up the details and background of the book. What awaited me was the unwelcome disaster of fundamentalist intolerance and rigidity! I found that the author was placed on a death warrant due to the book and the book was banned in India by then Indian Government. What the fuck??? That was my only thought.

What the book wanted to portray was how a religion needs to change with times. How each religion that was born and that died at some point in the entire minute history of humanity was a need of those times. Religions die and form as do humans. What can be more human about religions that this? Each religion is a living breathing organism that took shape due to the circumstances of times and was breathed a life into it by philosphers and idealists. Each religion that died was due to it becoming old and unbecoming, having wrinkles of outdated ideas and the alzheimer of social disconnect.

Islam too, was a need of the time. Muhammad, a man who was sick of the socio-political and economic frustrations of the time was the one who lead people to different path than what was nominal at that time. For him, that was reform. For his followers, this was the word of god. The very act of invoking god is enough to cease attention and unite even enemies under a common goal. That is what he did. To bring change, he brought about a new religion by trying to kill off the old ones. Was he getting revelations. I don't know. You don't know either. You were just told. But think about it, how many times have you in your class as a kid lied about something that you made up because it sounded good in your head and then made an excuse of ""my dad told me"" or ""I saw this/that person doing/saying this too""? TBH, even adults do this all the time. So was it a divine revelation? Not sure. What we can be sure of is that times have changed. People have changed. Society has changed. Not by large, but it has. So, why can't a religion change? Or any less, why can't a religion be demanded of change?

No matter which religion it is, if it doesn't go with throws of time, it gets disintegrated. Why can't we reform Islam? Is it because the religion says so? Or is it because those in power are just too unwilling to let go of the established mode of power and usher into a new era of reform where their own places won't be guaranteed? Why is the religion that was formed to reform the rule of Jahilia turning into a rule of Jahilia itself by suppressing any voice of contradiction and reform?

I read the news just an hour ago, and Natwar Singh said that ""The ban on the book was necessary was because it would have caused instability in the country's harmony."" This in mind translated as ""The ban was necessary because we didn't want to lose power."" Is thinking for yourself that big of a crime? Wasn't Muhammad a proponent of self-thought and self-reflection himself? The truth is, Islam was't built on the day Muhammad died, as many say. It wasn't complete then. It continued. What Muhammad started, many added their own twists to it, just to do the same that Muhammad did. Consolidate power to bring change. In Muhammad's hand, the change was that for reform of old. He may have also justified his mistakes using that method, but he was a human in the end and we cannot punish a dead man. What later apostles did was include their own ideas of how a society should be and what morals to keep and which to throw under a horse-cart. They also twisted many of previous ideas as they pleased as far as they could, meanwhile suppressing any dessent by making a joke of them or terming them blasphemous (thus prohibiting them forever from appearing again).

What the current Islamic society is doing, in spite of all the technological advancement is to follow the words of the people who claim true understanding of Islam while rejecting any free thought. If Islam accepts reform, it can achieve great things. Just like any other idea that did reform with time. The attack on Salman Rushdie shows that there is something wrong on Fundamental level with how we interpret and teach Islam to the younger generation. That needs to change.

For me, Islam and Qur'an are not only a religion and a set of morals to follow. For me, they both signify how one single man used his ideas to reform then society and how his ideas turned into a religion. People feel empty. It is in our psychology to do so. Maybe that is why we turn to gods and dieties. To full that gaping hole that just tries to eat us inside. That is why we want entertainment to ignore that void or intellectual food to fill that void. At various times, religion has helped provide us with entertainment by giving us stories and anecdotes and intellectual food by wrapping philosophy and morals into those stories and anecdotes. Religion is nothing but philosophy when its nude. It is the religious leaders that veil this philosophy and keep religion as an ever-hanging fruit that cannot be eaten but only seen.

At the end, I will leave these lines here for an open ending:

&gt;All men being by nature equal, the prophets cannot claim any intellectual or spiritual superiority. The miracles of the prophets are impostures or belong to the domain of pious legend. The teachings of religions are contrary to the one truth: the proof of this is that they contradict one another. It is tradition and lazy custom that have led men to trust their religious leaders. Religions are the sole cause of the wars which ravage humanity; they are hostile to philosophical speculation and to scientific research. The alleged holy scriptures are books without values.

I don't like thinking about it, but this one just seems too much. The Bible was translated/written before we as man knew that the moon didn't radiate light, and that it just reflects it. That being said, this could also be a mistranslation, or a miscommunication. However, I wouldn't call a mirror a light if I saw a light reflect on it.

236,"Let's take the story of Exodus for example. Is the reader to believe that when God is leading the Israelites through the desert, that God is nowhere else on Earth but there and doing nothing else but that? This event being described in the story is the most important thing happening in the world and that's why God is there and nowhere else, doing his thing for them and nobody else on Earth.  


Humans were all over the Earth at the time. Do followers of Judeo-Christian faiths not entertain the possibility that their god could have simultaneously been other places at the same time, appearing to other people, acquiring different names, inspiring different stories with different characters, while also facilitating the events of Exodus? I mean, this is the creator of the universe, we're talking about. The implication that delivering the Israelites from Egypt and proving his greatness to Pharaoh was the one and only thing God had going on in the world at the time... really boxes him in and shrinks him down from this omnipresent universal creator figure the he's supposed to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

It would seem that, in order to truly embrace the creator of the universe as our God, we can't box him in like that and we must at least listen to the stories from around the world and acknowledge the ways he's inspired the vast array of cultures we see today. It's what we all have in common that's important to knowing God.

Clearly it appears to stretch on forever in all directions, but we must assume there is an adge, but beyond that edge, the known mechanics break down, and we cannot know what is beyond.

But when you step outside into the public square, in the light of day, you had better behave yourself like a good secular citizen.”  This is referring to his decision to allow a football coach to perform Christian prayers on the 50 yard line after football games.  The coach in question was offered a different place to pray, but no, he said he felt, “compelled to pray in public in full view of the spectator stand”.

46," Very frequently i watch videos and read posts regarding why people believe what they believe, and as much, i see many things of people mocking other’s beliefs, i know its not necessarily the people and more so the religion itself, what i wanted to know to is if it is really exaggerated or the truth.

  I do understand there’s a certain amount of double standard and bias when it comes to favoring your arguments and your reasons, when such discussions are spoken to on the internet, it just seems like an argument or a debate is a life or death situation, a Christian very badly want to leave his 2 cents on an Athiest’s post and vice versa, you’ve got now youtubers making careers attacking other’s beliefs, people give themselves a savior/superiority complex on making a difference with their paragraphs on why YOU are wrong, and then, i take a step back, im watching other things, on TV,youtube,shows,etc. and i just see most people getting along, I’ve seen this Andrew Schulz stand up a while ago and seeing people from various cultures and religions just having a good time with the jokes on themselves sincerly landed the biggest smile on my face, and then i look at the life i live, I lived in a Muslim country for 20 years, the respect i have shown to my peers in Spain is reciprocated heavily, i grew up with Christian friends that supported and encouraged my fasting, I occasionally drove them to Church, I would have rational discussions with people of my faith, Christians, and Athiests regarding these topics, only in respect and in a dignified manner. 

  I was sheltered in my home country stuck with what im reading on subreddits like this and others and watching these youtubers that at the thought of when i leave for my education, i will be targeted with abuse, or that when i see things im not accustomed to, i will get an instinctual reaction to attack what people do, now i just realize that this need, this addiction to constantly have to see what a person in my faith says, what the opposer says, and who’s right and whatsoever, is that when you make a final decision on your choice of religion/spirituality/etc., i am just wasting my time, i have had my fair share of bad experiences with people who dont share the same faith, do i blame the religion? No, when i travelled to Spain did anyone expect me to leave tastless remarks to support my idealogy? No, did we all respect each other and it was the complete opposite of the fracture these  channels create to one up each other? Yes, Assim Al Hakeem cannot teach me on other cultures and religions and say they are demons when he only knows of one , AP can state his points that he has the right to do without ripping the Quran and offending people, are these two for examples representatives of their beliefs? Not at all. Never once in history have different societies agreed on the same things, i see it as pointless to attack and condemn when no one asked you to, and that goes for all religious people and agnostics/athiests, look up the definition these three terms, no where does it say an Athiest has to be anti-religious and vice versa, my dad works most of the year in Iran, knows many families there, has been in most of the country, and when i ask him is it the hellhole it’s described as and he gives me a No, and when my best friend went to the USA for uni and i asked him what many Muslims describe them he said the American people are amazing,and i can now say the same  after going to a European country, the stories people there tell me of the kind Muslims that were very nice to them is very different from your average exmuslim subreddit (and yes, some of their experiences are also in Muslim countries before anyone pulls out the “western muslim” excuse), my dad’s uncle who’s the same age as my dad was an athiest, never once did he insult my faith, an athiest that was much kinder than his coldhearted Muslim family members, we say religions cause separation, but its these labels that everyone from every corner stick out that just cause more separation in my eyes, in every ideal to unify people its all executed horribly, and hearing or experiencing one incident is suddenly a representative of a whole belief system.

   The fact is you are naturally a decent human bieng, and that we all have different opinions at the end of the day, i could die tomorrow by a Kanye fan for saying i dont like his music, it is natural to argue, and its very natural to disagree, but in the 21st century, after actually putting my phone down, stepping outside, and interacting with others, i realize this is not even a secondary priority, this enforced need of attacking someone is unnecessary, i have recieved so much racism in my life from my first name, from the country im in, i was called a terrorist among other things, im Syrian and my life has been destroyed by political and religious propoganda and i have my fair share of disdain towards the politicians but do i blame the Jewish for example? i never blame their beliefs nor their culture, that criticism would go to the person/people because:

-it would be unfair of me to judge everyone one the same way because of a few people’s actions

-i had much better experiences than bad ones

Matthew 22: 23-34

23 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,

24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:

26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.

27 And last of all the woman died also.

28 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.

29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.

30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

33 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.

34 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.

Jesus in verse 30: ""After death there are NO SOCIAL CONTRACTS.""

Jesus in verse 31: ""Have you not read the words of YOUR God?""

Jesus in verse 32: ""YOUR GOD SAID: ""I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."" THAT God is God of the living; which means that it controls things that occur on this side of existence, to the living, IN SOCIETY.

I was on vacation with a recent LDS convert friend of mine and he asked if I would attend services at the local Mormon Church. I agreed not knowing what to expect. 

To my surprise I liked this church service. I consider myself socially conservative on most issues and the sermon was right up my alley. The Bishop talked about the decline of the family and how upsetting it is to him. He talked about how the world is full of Satanic influences, many subtle, that work to destroy the family. He talked about how the internet is full of sites that destroy family values. Now you would think a secular guy like me would be angry and defensive hearing this sermon. No I loved it, he was saying all the things I think about a lot. 

One of my theories is that the popularity of the ""bad boy"" in recent years is one of the forces that has destroyed the family as these guys tend not to make good family men. As I looked around the church I only saw nice wholesome looking men. I finally found a place that is not pro-bad boy. It was amazing to me. This was a big difference from the mga churches I went to where the church goers looked more like what you would see out in public at random, perhaps only slightly more cleancut looking. Also the sermon at the megachurches focused more on how God will forgive sinners while the Mormon church was more critical of the sins..which I found very refreshing.

&gt;took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing azl (withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah’s Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah’s Messenger, and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.

But these two in the title are something you simply should not do for a plethora of reasons, the least of which being that it would make you look submissive and think people can step all over you. 

If someone were to slap you, Jesus would say to turn the other cheek and walk away. Now sometimes this can be a good thing, having restraint. But that's all they get, one hit. After that, all bets should be off and you should hit them back harder. It's only fair. Besides, to use a more modern example, if a bully punches you at school and you decide to walk away, do you think this is going to stop them from hitting you again? Of course not. It'll embolden him, more than anything, since he knows he can do it again. And again and again. But, when you stand up to him, when you hit him back, even when it could cost you a suspension, you've shown him that you're not to be messed with, and he will likely stop. And your worries will be gone. Turning the other cheek solves nothing and only creates more problems. 

As for loving your enemies, this is simply laughable. If someone is your legitimate ""enemy"", meaning they deliberately want to hurt you and those you care about, or want to bring harm into your life through some public policy because they disagree with your sexuality and sexual preferences, they are your enemy. And why love someone who hates you? You shouldn't. It doesn't make any sense. Fight your enemies, do whatever it takes to stop them. Don't ""love"" them and show them a modicum of respect, because they simply do not deserve it. 

All turning the other cheek and loving your enemies does is open the door for others to walk all over you. Politeness and manners only go so far. Even disagreeing political opinions only goes so far.

Of course the argument that Rapture believers make is that God loves true christians so much that he's not going to let them suffered through the great tribulation. But I ask, what exactly is a ''true christian''? Is it people who are ''born again christians''? I mean the idea of being a ''born again christian'' is a 19th century American christian fundamentalist idea. It's not something that early Christianity ever taught.

And that's the thing. The Rapture is mostly a North American evangelical protestant doctrine. It's not something that's believed in the rest of the christian world.

Also it's safe to say that the Bible never teachers the Rapture. Sure there's some vague verses that say something about being ''whisked off in the in the twinkling of an eye'' or about God keeping you out of danger, but Rapture believing christians take those verses and cut around them with scissors and then put those verses in Revelation or in Ezekiel or in the Gospel of Matthew and then they claim that the Bible teachers the Rapture. It's ridiculous.

It's to my understanding that the TST and the theistic Satanists also have their own rituals and holidays and stuff. Again, I don't believe in anything of the sort, but it just seems interesting to me and I'd like to try new things. 

That being said, I've noticed that the word ""ritual"" is thrown around mostly in non-Christian religions.

150,"Hi,

Thought I'd post something given that my religious journey is quite odd and someone somewhere might provide some meaningful input.

I was raised Roman Catholic, but have really grown to dislike the religion based on the hierarchical  structure and the theological teachings (they don't make sense to me). It's not for me. For a bit I was a Baha'i. It seemed like a fitting religion-- more ritualistic, which I like, but still progressive. I never could bring myself to fully embrace Baha'u'llah as a Messenger of God, however. Being a part of that community was wonderful, however, and I don't think I've met a collective group of kinder individuals.

I've read the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads-- I couldn't get behind the central message of the former, but I did appreciate the latter. My issue with the Bhagavad Gita was the notion that we should do things based on our duty, even if we feel they are wrong. Maybe I was interpreting it incorrectly-- and someone can correct me. The Upanishads I read a very long time ago, I remember enjoying them thoroughly as pieces of literature, but they did not quite stick with me the way I would like a religious text to. At the time of reading them, I looked into Advaita Vedanta as a religion, and even reached out to some communities in my area. I never ended up meeting them: I don't think I was fully invested. I've also read the Tao Teh Ching, and had a similar reaction as I did with the Upanishads. I less looked at Taoism as a potential religion for myself than as something to learn about.

Throughout all of this, however, I have had a continued interest in Islam. It began when I heard a quote from the Quran: 

&gt;96:1  
&gt;  
&gt;ٱقْرَأْ بِٱسْمِ رَبِّكَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ١  
&gt;  
&gt;Read, ˹O Prophet,˺ in the Name of your Lord Who created—  
&gt;  
&gt;96:2  
&gt;  
&gt;خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ ٢  
&gt;  
&gt;created humans from a clinging clot.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;— Dr. Mustafa Khattab, the Clear Quran

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a random verse to strike someone, but it is specifically the note about the ""clot"". See, when I was younger I had visions and hallucinations-- all of which were the result of a psychiatric condition for which I am medicated. But a consistent vision I had was of God creating every being from clots of blood.

Of course, one could easily disregard these visions as the result of my condition, and I agree. But I do not think God gives us trials for nothing. Perhaps this vision has meaning afterall, and my enduring interest in Islam and draw due to this verse is warranted.

From here, we'll see where I go. I've read most of the Quran, and my ambition now it to read the entirety of it. I've always, as a white American, felt intimidated by the Muslim community-- as if I am an outsider. But I think it's time I get over my hesitancies and take the first steps toward making some friends in the faith.

Anyway, that's my story so far. Feel free to comment if you'd like. Upvote, downvote-- do whatever. The choice is yours. Peace.",From almost everything to... Muslim?,religion

Did the British also have time machines that enabled to them to go back in time to author the Manusmriti?

However, the following page on the top right corner says ""Genesis 4:12"".

This is very odd, considering there literally hasn't been a break in witchcraft since the dawn of civilization. Heck, even Christianity's disgusting persecution of witches provides a nice clear paper-trail of the existence of Witchcraft from antiquity up to modern time. We've never gone anywhere, just gotten better at surviving constant targeted persecution. Heck, their own religious documents go on about us at length (often making up lies about how we're so horrible in some way). It's very visible, there's been some form of witchcraft at pretty much every point through history. Not to mention we have grimores that you can buy on Amazon that date back to the before even Judaism that are accepted part of witchcraft lore.  Like, there's no shortage on historical and modern documentaiton.

And to top it off, which-craft isn't even a religion that requires some unbroken chain. It's flexible and re-kindlable by its very nature. It's basically folk spirituality. And even in spite of that, there are witches with unbroken chains of folk-spirituality going back to older historical witches. 

And in the mirror, though there's something very different about Christians.

Christianity has a *very* clear break in its history. Back when Chrsitianity was still a sect of Judaism, the Essene-Christian sect abandoned Jerusalem when Rome was planning seige. For this act, Christianity was excommunicated from Judaism. Finto, done. Solid breaking point. Christianity relied on the unbroken chain of Abraham before that (As Jesus said, he came for Israel, not gentiles). Christianity-as-was-is-now-gone. We have a clear and definite historical end to the original Christianity. The current Christianity is just like some vague Roman echo of that ended Jewish sect. 

So, there is a definite and pointed moment in time that we can point to and say, ""Christians are Larpers, because there are no real Christians after this point"", (Not to mention the ""larping"" aspects of I've never seen a Christian live up to the ""proof of being a Christian"" in Mark 16:18). There's *definite* reasons to call Christians ""larpers"", but no such thing for

When you look at children, they fight, and are insanely jealous and self-centered. That's just what they do. So I side more with Christianity's idea of original sin.

It seems in Islam you are not born to original sin - you are born a blank slate and can only start sinning when you hit puberty. Afterwards, when you are led into temptation and sin, if you repent to Allah it will be forgiven. This is how in the Quran, Adam was forgiven for eating the apple. He repented and original sin was not passed on to humanity. Afterwards it seems to me from reading some articles and some reddits in the Islam section that life is a constant battle of having more good deeds than bad deeds, like on a balance.

I was reading this article:

[https://marytn.medium.com/original-sin-and-salvation-muslim-perspective-3fcb8987c121](https://marytn.medium.com/original-sin-and-salvation-muslim-perspective-3fcb8987c121)

This author seems to think that the idea of the savior sacrificing himself is a ""pagan"" notion that is completely alien to Islam and Judaism (I can't find the quote on that now, argh). Here is another interesting snippet:

*"" The Islamic understanding of Jesus as a prophet rather than as God or  the Son of God corresponds to the understanding of the early, original  Christians. As is known by Biblical scholars, after Jesus’s time, pagan  notions were added to the pure Message revealed to him by his Lord,  whereby he was ‘transformed’ into God/the Son of God and the third  person of the Trinity. ""*

So obviously no guarantee that what this article is saying is scholarly in any way, but I came across an interesting paragraph in Neil Gaiman's Norse Mythology (page 1):

*""Odin knows many secrets. He gave an eye for wisdom. More than that, for knowledge of runes, and for power, he sacrificed himself to himself.""*

It seems to me there is a similarity between Jesus being crucified, essentially by himself, since he is also God, and Odin sacrificing himself. So maybe there is a connection between the idea of the Savior sacrificing himself in Christianity and pagan religions. But Odin sacrificed himself for essentially what pissed God off about Adam and Eve! So that's all I have today, because that thought just confused me.

""*I think this is very clear: a Church that does not develop its thinking in an ecclesial sense, is a Church that is going backward. This is today’s problem, of many who call themselves “traditional”. No, they are not traditional. They are “backwardist” people who look to the past, going backward, without roots. “It has always been done that way, that’s how it was done last century”. And looking “backward” is a sin because it does not progress with the Church. Tradition.... is the living faith of those who have died. Instead, for those people who are looking backward, who call themselves traditionalists, it is the dead faith of the living. Tradition is precisely the root of the inspiration to go forward in the Church. And this is always vertical. And “backwardness” is going backward, it is always closed. It is important to understand well the role of tradition, which is always open, like the roots of the tree, and the tree grows like that... A musician used a very beautiful phrase. Gustav Mahler used to say that tradition in this sense is the guarantee of the future; it is the guarantee, not a museum piece. If you conceive tradition as closed, that is not Christian tradition. It is always the sap of the root that carries you forward, forward, forward... So for that reason we must think and carry forward faith and morals*""(Apostolic visit to Canada, press conference)

""*When we consider the ambient culture, and its variety of languages and symbols, we must be careful not to fall prey to pessimism or resentment, passing immediately to negative judgments or a vain nostalgia. There are two possible views we can have towards the world in which we live: I would call one “the negative view”, and the other “the discerning view”. he negative view, is often born of a faith that feels under attack and thinks of it as a kind of “armour”, defending us against the world.  This view bitterly complains that “the world is evil; sin reigns”, and thus risks clothing itself in a “crusading spirit”.  We need to be careful, because this is not Christian; it is not, in fact, the way of God, who – as the Gospel reminds us – “so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life” (Jn 3:16).  The Lord detests worldliness and has a positive view of the world.  He blesses our life, speaks well of us and our situation, and makes himself incarnate in historical situations, not to condemn, but to give growth to the seed of the Kingdom in those places where darkness seems to triumph.  If we are limited to a negative view, however, we will end up denying the incarnation: we will flee from reality, rather than making it incarnate in us.  We will close in on ourselves, lament our losses, constantly complain and fall into gloom and pessimism, which never come from God.  We are called, instead, to have a view similar to that of God, who discerns what is good and persistently seeks it, sees it and nurtures it.  This is no naïve view, but a view that discerns reality.""*(Apostolic visit to Canada, Homily to Bishops)

""*Let us go forth, then; let us go forth to offer everyone the life of Jesus Christ. Here I repeat for the entire Church what I have often said to the priests and laity of Buenos Aires: I prefer a Church which is bruised, hurting  and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security. I do not want a Church concerned with being at the centre and then ends by being caught up in a web of obsessions and procedures....More than a fear of going astray, my hope is that we will be moved by the fear of remaining shut up within structures which give us a false sense of security, within rules which make us harsh judges, within habits which make us feel safe, while at our door people are starving and Jesus does not tire of saying to us 'Give them something to eat*'""(The Joy of the Gospel, prg 49)

""*To be credible to young people there are times when she(the Church) needs to regain her humility and simply listen, recognising that what others have to say can provide some light to help better understand the Gospel. A Church always on the defensive, which loses her humility and stops listening to others, which leaves no room for questions, loses her youth and turns into a museum. How, then, will she be able to respond to the dreams of young people? Even if she possesses the truth of the Gospel, this does not mean she has completely understood it; rather she is called to keep growing in her grasp of that inexhaustible treasure*""(Christus Vivit, prg 41) 

""*Woe to you, scholars of the law. You have taken away the key of knowledge. This is the warning of Jesus. When we go down the street and find ourselves in front of a church that is locked, we feel something strange because a locked church makes no sense. Sometimes they give pretexts, justifications, but the reality is that the church is locked and the people walking cannot go in. And even worst, the Lord is inside and he can't get out. In the Gospel, Jesus speaks to us of this image of closure; it is the image of those Christians who have the key in hand, but they take it way, they don't open the door. On the contrary and even worst, they lock the door and so not allow others to enter themselves.....But how does it happen that a Christian falls into this attitude of keeping the door locked and the key in his pocket? Faith passes through a still, so to speak, and becomes an ideology. And ideology doesn't share. There is no room for Jesus in ideologies: his tenderness, love, meekness. And the ideologies are rigid, always. In every way: rigid. And when a Christian becomes a disciple of ideology, he has lost his faith. He is no longer a disciple of Jesus*""(Encounter with Truth, Homily, October 17, 2013) 

""*Fundamentalism is a sickness which exists in all religions. We Catholics have some people – not just a few, but a lot – who believe they possess absolute truth and go around slandering and defaming everyone else; they do a lot of harm. I say this because it’s my Church, but it is all of us! And we have to fight against it. Religious fundamentalism is not religious. Why? Because God is missing. It is idolatrous, just as money is idolatrous. Being political, in the sense of winning over people who have this tendency… that is the “politics” in which we religious leaders must engage. But fundamentalism, which always ends up in tragedy or crime, is something evil, but there is a bit of it in every religion.*""(Apostolic journey to Africa, Press Conference)

""*There is a principle worth remembering in these times: ideas are debated but reality is discerned. This is a difficult thing for those of a more impatient disposition, who believe that to every problem there must be a technical solution, as if it were merely a question of finding the right switch. Many religious people, too, struggle with discernment, especially those who are allergic to uncertainty and want to reduce everything to black and white. And it is quite impossible for ideologues, fundamentalists and anyone else who is held back by a rigid mindset. But discernment is vital if we want to create a better future*""(Let us Dream, pg 54) 

""*It is an illusion to think that we can go back to where we were. Attempts at restoration always take us down a dead-end street. Faced with this uncertainty, ideology and the rigid mindset have an allure that we must resist. Fundamentalism is a means of assembling thought and behavior as a refuge that supposedly protects a person from a crisis. Fundamentalist mindsets offer to shelter people from destabilising situations in exchange for a kind of existential quietism. They offer you an attitude and a single, closed way of thinking, as a substitute for the kind of thinking that opens you up to truth. Whoever takes refuge in fundamentalism is afraid of setting out on a road to truth. He already 'has' the truth and deploys it as a defense, so that any questioning of it is interpreted as an aggression against his person*""(Let us Dream, pg 54-55)",Pope Francis's views on traditionalism in religion and the church in quotes for those who are interested.,religion

God doesn't like doubters every religious person tells me but I'm a very keen individual and can tell if someone is truly genuine or convincing themselves.  Now I have met people whom I detected zero doubt and that is truly special and I admire that! Basically I thought I was a bad person for trying to plant the seed of doubt within these people but I have realized what I have been doing isn't actually bad. I'm making them realize their doubt and confront it and in doing so they either branch away or become that much closer to the relgion. I'm tired of being treated like a bad guy for questioning stuff atleast I'm not lying thyself about how I feel and I believe in a concept of God yes but as for which Bible translation is corect...ect I could honestly care less. It's so funny and ironic all religions except paganism belive in one God and yet fight and kill eachother over the minor details and differences, I won't be apart of the hate. I think religion was created as a set of golden rules which all humans should abide by. No killing no raping...ect. long ago everyone just pillaged and raped eachother the world was utter chaos. Religion has good lessons in it on an individual level but as a whole has caused so many holy wars and bloodshed. Think about it why do most people cry out to God on their death beds? Because of fear. I will not become a slave to fear I want to believe but I want to genuinely belive . Any religious person whom I speak to that I sense no doubt in I tell them sway me to believe,  make me belive and no one has been able to move me. One pet peve is when people can only defend their faith with Bible verses to me that's the opposite of what you should be doing. God wants you to convert people but with your own words if you can't defend your faith in your own words you do not belive . I WANT TO BELIVE I DO SO MUCH.

6,"A near-death experience - abbreviated as ‘NDE’ - is an experience that is reported by many people either on the verge of death or who have been pronounced clinically dead.

There remains some controversy about what causes near-death experiences and what their ultimate meaning is, but there is no question about their incidence or their impact on people.

If the mainstream view that consciousness is a product of physiological processes in the brain is correct there can be no survival of consciousness after bodily death. This is the fundamental biological objection to the NDE.

There are, however, many well documented cases of empirical phenomena that are difficult or impossible to explain from the conventional point of view. These include things like extreme physiological influence by psychosomatic means. There is an extensive history of research on NDEs occurring under anesthesia or cardiac arrest where the conditions that 99% of neuroscientists believe are necessary for conscious experience have been abolished. 

Typically the person feels a tremendous sense of wellbeing during the NDE. Initially there is a sense of being separated from the physical body, being able to see the physical body as a spectator to it from an elevated position.

If the person goes more deeply into the experience there is oftentimes a feeling of moving through a dark and enclosed space, like a tunnel, at an increasingly high speed moving towards a radiant light. As they enter into the aura of this light many things happen, they are flooded with a sense of omniscient universal knowledge and of an absolute and unconditional love.

Sometimes the person will report being given a review or “reliving” of their life from the emotional perspective of those affected by their own actions and emotions. Other times they will meet a spiritual entity or deceased loved one who tells them that they have to go back and return to their physical body. 

Universally people come back from an NDE imbued with a sense of meaning and purpose, and with a loss of the fear of death. This sense that life has meaning is an inextricable part of the NDE.

These are the staple elements that define a typical NDE. This is an experience that has now been reported by many thousands of people from all cultures around the globe.

The interpretation of these experiences vary from culture to culture, but the basic phenomena remains the same around the world across the centuries. Although the interpretation of the phenomena may be influenced by culture, the actual experience appears not to be.

Invariably those who have this experience, irrespective of their initial point of view on religion or spirituality, come to hold a worldview similar to that of the perennial philosophy. They come to have a tolerance for the diversity of religious and spiritual worldviews within the overarching framework of this perennial philosophy.

The near-death phenomena would seem to lend an enormous amount of credence to a worldview which is very different from the conventional materialistic scientific way of understanding the world, and which is more like the “perennial philosophy” that forms the basic assumptions which underlie the religions of the world.

20," Let's begin with the myth: According to Hindu mythology, Rama's Bridge was built by a legion of flying monkeys at the behest of Lord Ram so that he could cross from India to Sri Lanka to rescue his kidnapped wife. Sounds utterly ridiculous, I know. You'd think this was something people maybe believed 1,000 years ago, but this remains not only a prevalent belief to day, but remains at the center of numerous legal cases wherein shipping companies have wanted to build a channel though Rama's Bridge. Hindu devotees, on the other hand, have argued that the miraculous creation of Rama's Bridge and its historical value is a testemony to the truth of Hindu epics as reliable historical records, thus necessitating the bridge's preservation.

The belief in the bridge's supernatural origins are a subject of numerous pseduoscientic claims and scientific dishonesty amongst Hindu apologists. For example, one 2003 pseudoscientific study S.M. Ramasamy reported that ""carbon dating of the beaches roughly matches the dates of Ramayana, its link to the epic needs to be explored"". This would suggest that the geological formations making up Rama's Bridge were only 3,500 year old, not 1.7 million years as thought by secular geologists ([The Indian Express, February 3, 2003](https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/ramas-bridge-is-only-3500-years-old-crs/)).

Similarly, an article in the official publication of the Indian National Remote Sensing Centre in 2008 reported that the geological evidence for Lord Ram's miraculous construction of the 48km (30mi) long bridge in only 5 days by a team of intelligent flying monkeys was not only credible (contrary to known science and basic intelligence), but suggested that the government of India and the world scientific community should take the Hindu epics far more seriously as a source of scientific knowledge ([link](https://web.archive.org/web/20071220055922/http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14573009)).

So how do sensible people know that Rama's Bridge wasn't built by flying monkeys? First, we can discount the idea of an almost 50km long bridge having been built in 5 days. Not even a team of highly experienced army engineers could conceivably pull off that trick in so short a time. Second, we can discount the idea of an army of highly trained flying monkeys, even with engineering degrees, ever building such a structure. That idea is not only pure fantasy, but sounds like something straight out of an L. Frank Baum fantasy children's story. And third, falsifying the results carbon dating to date Rama's Bridge to within 3,500 years isn't something that any scientist with any sense of self-respect would do, and that is the only way in which you can acheive those results.

And so I content that Rama's Bridge was NOT built by Lord Ram and that the continued insistance of the Hindu pseudeoscientific community that Rama's Bridge shows the Hindu epics to be true is an embrassment to every Indian and every person with Hindu heritage.",Rama's Bridge was NOT built by flying monkeys,religion

22,"As a person deeply interested in theology, I try to respect other religious views. I, of course disagree with a whole lot of them, but I try to still think highly and I must say, it takes no special effort.

Of course, as a Christian, I believe Jews are risking when they deny that Jesus is the Messiah, but I can still admire these religions.

My understanding is that all these religions at their root represent humans thinking and pondering the divine. The way they develop might well contain a lot of flaws. Perhaps misread texts, later legends assumed to be older than they are, slightly odd metaphysics etc. They fascinate us and we love studying about them.

I don’t need to be a Muslim to admire how the legends of Alexander the Great got incorporated into Islamic tradition. I don’t need to be a fundamentalist either. There is no reason to think that presence of legends or prior stories somehow “destroys” any given religion. We can be edified by myths that point us to the divine.

What I see in all of these religions, though is a desire for truth. The falsehoods in these religions come from development, mistaken attribution, philosophies of the day, and perhaps a few charlatans whose influence was never fully shred even though attempts were always there.

With Mormonism though, the case is different. Increasing amount of evidence suggests to us, non-Mormons, that falsehoods in Mormonism are not products of development but bitter, cynical and likely deliberate deception all the way from Joseph Smith to perhaps up to today.

Thus, while I can debate 5th century legends people believe come from 1st century, let’s say, I am less inclined to debate the issue of whether Adam and Eve lived in Missouri, because I think it’s not actually something that was ever posited as anything but outright attempt to deceive.

All serious folks who seek the truth agree and understand that the Book of Mormon is not a product of any development, but represents cynical and bitter attempt to deceive deliberately.

As Christians then, should we not be against such abuses in any religion? Of course, but what can we say about a religion that itself was created and is still sustained by deliberately and cynically lying to people?

Finally, Simon Peter speaks: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” You are the *Mashiach*, the “anointed one,” the long-awaited Savior; but more to it, you are the Son of God, not just a human hero. This is the mystical faith that stands at the heart of Christianity. To hold this Petrine faith is to be a Christian; to deny it is to deny Christianity.  
And then those amazing words of Jesus: “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father.” This insight did not come from Simon’s own intelligent speculation. It came from above, through grace, from God. And this is why Peter is a rock.  
The Church is built not on a worldly foundation of any kind but on a mystical foundation, born of Peter’s faith in the revealing God. The Church is neither democratic nor aristocratic—it is charismatic. And this is where its power comes from.",The Source of Faith? (St. Peter's Confession),religion

51,"A recent post inspired me to think about the differences between popular and theological views of God. For example, the Bible, especially in the earliest books, talks about God as though he is a being like any other in the universe, just bigger and more powerful. He even has a body. A great book on this is [God: an anatomy](https://www.amazon.com/God-Anatomy-Francesca-Stavrakopoulou-ebook/dp/B08XB6JHQT/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=god+an+anatomy+francesca+stavrakopoulou&amp;qid=1659637212&amp;sprefix=God+an+a%2Caps%2C176&amp;sr=8-1).

But as Judaism evolved that portrayal went out of the window, and to my understanding, modern Judaism and Islam go out of their way to say that God is **not** a being like anything else in the universe. Christian theology does this too, but because Jesus is God and Man, it's messy. 

Most believers  in any religion believe in their scripture's portrayal of God where God is interacting with people like another being, albeit a very powerful one, and that's how they see God.

The ground of being couldn't care less about helping you find your car keys, but a cute and cuddly  Jesus who walks and talks with you, would.

I’m seeing more and more religious people that take this things as if not more seriously than atheists, even if at first glance it may seem to contradict the religion.

Some atheists may see it as a weakness or having the cake and eating it too, as if it’s a convenient ignoring of the faith to fit modern society, but I appreciate it and see it as a strength, to have a perspective outside of the religion even if it challenges it in some way in the view of other religious people, and to find a way to remain faithful, it takes maturity and a willingness to welcome complexity and not having a black and white view.

117,"In my formative years, I was aware of a certain intellectual *obsession* with beliefs- in a felt moral imperative to attempt to analyze the veracity of the variety of beliefs, and in the necessity of analyzing myself and my values and systematically defining the various aspects of my being in terms of clearly articulated and defined beliefs. I was like a butterfly taxonomist, pinning everything about myself onto a bounded board with clear labels; these are my politics, this is my theology, this is my sexuality, etc. I think a lot of this probably has to do with “coming online” as a teenager of the internet, and being awash in the deluge of information as to how many apparently legitimate and vastly different ways there were of being human, and the anxiety that that evoked, but that is somewhat of a digression. 

But one of the things that I discovered is how often doomed this approach to self-knowledge is. We are not fully transparent to ourselves; otherwise, we would not require the entire scientific enterprise of psychology. In studying psychoanalysis, I began to realize much more concretely that a person’s actions are the true profession of what they believe, which was often in conflict with what a person consciously thought of themselves. And I realized that the moment that I thought I had finally and totally pinned some aspect of myself down, it went and changed on me, as human being is a constant flux of causes and conditions, in response to a constantly shifting environment. 

I think this is something that makes online discussion of beliefs an inherently [wicked problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem), as we cannot observe a person’s behavior to see if their self-assessment of what they believe is in actual accord with how they live. It is, perhaps, less of a problem within in-person religious communities, as the social surround can potentially provide corrective feedback, regarding the incongruities. 

I don’t like to de facto dismiss people based on their self-professions of belief, and assume that I actually have greater insight into their psyche. Although that temptation does sometimes exist, and perhaps not without some manner of actual insight. But I also do believe that many of us are suffering from some culturally enforced divorce between ego and self, between who we think we are and who we really are, and that this is fundamentally a religious or spiritual problem that must be addressed.

for some strange reason I’m very interested in buying an amulet. No clue why just a weird urge. Because of this I decided to read up on them, and I can’t seem to wrap my head around the following:

1) Does wearing the Hamsa Hand horizontally stand for up or down or neither? Does it even work if you wear it that way? 

2) What if the owner wears both amulets? Doesn’t that contradict each other? Should one choose only one to wear or wear both? It feels greedy and bad on first thought to do.

3) Does wearing the Hamsa Hand in both ways make any sense? Because it’s like asking the best of both worlds. 

4) Does this amulet even know when you are the owner? I was thinking what if I buy one of these evil eyes and it backfires on me, lol?!

5) It says the Hamsa Hand stands for protection if worn up. And it says its eye is the evil eye protection. So does that mean if worn up, not protecting you from anything else negative aside from the evil eye?

225,"One of the things that's been in the news lately is the Pope's visit to Canada as well as his apology for residential schools. When one takes a step back though an analyse Pope Francis's interactions with the indigenous populations of the Americas one sees a pretty fascinating complexity both in terms of how each group views him and how he has interacted with each group depending on culture and region. Let me break it down.

The indigenous Canadians and Native Americans would be indigenous peoples that live in the ""Anglosphere"" nations. English speaking countries, which Canada and America are. The indigenous populations in Mexico, Central and America are indigenous groups that are Latin America. Now the way Pope Francis has interacted with each has been markedly different, which shows the complexity of the man. Putting it simply when it comes to issues affecting indigenous peoples of the Anglosphere Pope Francis has been ***slow, cautious, conservative and incrementalist*** in terms of how he approaches their issues. By contrast when it comes to the indigenous peoples of Latin America he has been ***bold and revolutionary*** in terms of his approach to social justice their.

Now why the contrast? Well one of the reasons is the fact that he is the first Argentine Pope from South America. That impacts his perspectives on global issues. The Pope became Pope in 2013. The first time he met Native Americans was around 2015. The first time he met Indigenous Canadians was around 2016 or 2017. So we are talking about a 5 to 7 year window there and not in significant numbers. By contrast before he became Pope Francis, as Jorge Mario Bergoglio was a priest in South America since 1969. He as been interacting with indigenous peoples their for 53 years. More than half a century. As a result he has a very close and personal relationship with them and has a much deeper understanding of their issues. Because of this he is much more likely to be bold and decisive when addressing issues of colonialism and social justice and we have real examples of this.

When looking last year for instance when the story of unmarked graves broke the Pontiffs initial remarks were cautious in nature. Which frustrated many in Canada. By contrast that same summer their were three times the Pope and his allies intervened in issues affecting indigenous people. During the same month the unmarked graves story broke in Panama the government and corporations their pushing for construction projects on unceded indigenous territory and the Pontiffs allies in the Catholic Church were leading the charge against. The Pope met indigenous communities from the Amazon that same summer as well, and in September the Pope's allies in Brazil worked with indigenous leaders to organise grassroots led resistance against the Bolsanaro government and the Supreme Court's denial of constitutionally guaranteed protections. In 2015 right when the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada concluded he was first presented with its findings by Prime Minister Stephen Harper but hadn't responded immediately at the time. During that same exact summer he stood with Evo Morales the first indigenous president of Bolivia, apologised for the crimes of colonialism in front of indigenous people, and gave a sweeping speech with marching orders to fight neo colonialism in economic system, incarceration system, the media and other practises against indigenous people. This was followed by the creation of REPAM, a network that does that on the ground through giving legal and social assistance to indigenous groups battling multinational corporations in the Amazon and throughout Latin America. Earlier this April the Pontiff apologised to indigenous Canadians in the Vatican and while a milestone it was still cautious in nature. That same week right after meeting the indigenous delegation from Canada, he met a delegation from Peru to back their efforts against the mining industry and to internationalise their campaign. His allies in REPAM such as Pedro Baretto had been battling the mining industry's poisoning of the water as well as the air to the point of assassination threats against them with his blessing. So it has been a incremental conservatism when it comes to Anglosphere issues, compared to a revolutionary approach to social justice influenced by Liberation theology in the Latin countries.

We also see this complexity in terms of how he is perceived. In the Anglo sphere nations, while not monolithic, Pope Francis is more likely to be seen by many indigenous canadians and Native Americans as simply just another white dude leading an institution they perceive as colonial in nature. By contrast in Latin America(not monolithic as well) he is by in large seen differently, and we see this in the commentary of Evo Morales who as I mentioned was Latin America's first indigenous president and himself part of the revolutionary politics of the region. He refers to him as ""brother Francis"". They perceive him as their fellow Latin American compatriot who happens to be in Rome but who's an ally for social justice. So these are just some nuances and complexities on these topics.",Pope Francis and Indigenous peoples in Canada and the United States vs Latin America.

227,"Hi, r/religion!

Today is the 3rd day of the Hebrew month of Av. In exactly a week, next sunday, Jews around the world will observe the Fast of the Ninth of Av (I will explain the funny math in a second). What is this fast? What is it about? How is it followed? I thought I would make a guide, with the goal of inter-religious dialogue.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ninth of Av: The destruction of the Temple**

If you read through the Torah, one thing that is abundantly clear is the importance of sacrifices.  Sacrifices are critical for instances of transgressions against G-d, they have several hundreds of Mitzvot and Halachot tied to them, and are generally a big part of how the Torah understands Israel's relationship with G-d. You will notice however that modern Judaism does not contain any sacrifices. What happened?

The Torah (Leviticus 19:3-9) forbids sacrifices anywhere other than Mishkan, and later outside of the Temple. All of this was well and good - until we fast-forward to 586 BCE, when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple - on the Ninth day of the Month of AV, 3339 (according to the Jewish calendar). This of course was a horrifying shock to the world's Jewish population, who were exiled and held in captivity in Babylon for 70 years before being allowed to return to their land by King Cyrus, and set about rebuilding the Temple. The Second Temple, less glorious and holy than the first but still insanely holy, was rebuilt in either 351 BCE (Chazal Sources) or 516 BCE (according to some historians). This Temple stood and continued serving as the center of Jewish life until the Jewish Rebellion against the Roman Empire, when the Romans sieged Jerusalem, broke through its walls, captured the city and ultimately burned down the Temple - on the Ninth Day of the Month of Av, 3830 (according to the Jewish calendar). The destruction of the Temple was followed by edicts exiling the Jews from their land, forbidding them entrance to Jerusalem, crushing the last pieces of Rebellion, and ultimately, the destruction of the Jewish city of Jerusalem in order to build a new city named Aelia Capitolina on top of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ninth of Av: A day of Destruction**

The Talmud records five disasters for the people of Israel that occured on Tish'a B'av - The people of Israel were denied entry to the Land of Israel after the Spies' Transgressions (Numbers 13-15), The First and Second Temple were destroyed, the Rebel city of Beitar was captured and massacred by the Romans, and the Destruction of Jerusalem in order to build Aelia Capitolina. Since the Talmudic times, Tish'a B'av is seen as a time of troubles, bad news and destruction in Jewish history. Some ""highlights"" occuring around this time period are:

The Jewish expulsion from England (Tisha B'av 1290), France (Tenth of Av, 1306) and Spain (Seventh of Av, 1492)

Formal approval of the ""Final Solution"" (Tisha B'av 1941)

The biggest Warsaw Ghetto liquidation to Treblinka extermination camp (Tisha B'av 1943)

The AMIA bombing, killing 85 Argentian Jews and injuring 300 (Tenth of Av 1994)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ninth of Av: A day of Fast and Mourning**

Given its role as the date of the destruction of the Temple, Jews around the world fast and observe mourning laws during Tisha B'av. Examples include:

During Tish'a B'av, Religious Jews do not eat, drink, bathe, use perfumes, wear leather shoes or engage in marital activities.

People wear unwashed clothes (see next section) and not to don Tefillin or a Tallit untill midday.

The Torah is read without cantillation in synagogues. The cloth covering the holy Ark is removed. The book of Lamentations (Eicha in Hebrew) is read in the synagogue in evening and morning services, and lamentations written by Jewish poets are read extensively during the services.

People avoid sitting on any seat or any furniture taller than a cubit, instead sitting on the ground. Sleeping is done on a mattress or directly on the ground, with no pillow.

Torah study is forbidden on Tisha B'av, other than Torah talking about the destruction of the Temple.

Some people traditionally do not greet others on Tisha B'av, as the Jewish greeting is ""Shalom"" (peace), which is considered a name of G-d.

&amp;#x200B;

Tisha B'av starts at sundown and ends at sunup. Since these actions are not becoming of Shabbat, as Shabbat is a joyous occasion, in years where Tisha B'av falls on Shabbat (such as this year), Tisha B'av is postponed to the Tenth of Av (Sunday).

&amp;#x200B;

**The Three Weeks**

In Judaism, there are four fasts commemorating the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. The fast before Tisha B'av is the 17th of Tamuz, which is exactly three weeks before Tisha B'av. During these three weeks, increasing mourning practices are adopted by people, such as:

Avoiding music.

No haircuts.

No shaving.

No weddings or joyous ocassions (if possible).

No eating meat or drinking wine (starting on the 1st of Av)

No washing clothes (starting on the 1st of AV)

No bathing for pleasure or going to the sea (starting 1st of Av)

&amp;#x200B;

**After Tisha B'av**

Av in general is considered a sad month in Judaism. It is said in the Mishna ""once Av enters, we avoid joy"". Weddings are traditionally not held until the 15th of Av, and after Av comes the somber month of Elul, readying for the High Holidays that will come two months after Tisha B'av.","In exactly a week, Jews around the world will observe Tish'a B'av.

Currently, Witchcraft is experiencing exponential growth with a rapidly increasing Δ (a very healthy ΔΔ in fact, largely only matched by Christianity's growth under Constantine or Islam under Mohammud), while Christianity's Δ continues to decline with a negative ΔΔ, indicating it will likely reach peak sometime around 2035 before steady decline towards a dead religion begins, all the while Witchcraft making exponential increases, expected to hit primary Δ in 2030.

So much judgemental behavior. So much hatred and bile. It would be around 2008, when I discovered the existence of the Westboro Baptist Church, that I would denounce my faith completely and renounce God and become and atheist. 

However.

Something never quite sat right. And recently I had this dream. In the dream a woman approached me and said she was the creator of all things, good and bad. And she explained everything to me, the purpose of it all. Naturally, I forgot it when I woke up, but I remember crying to her about how angry I had been, about how much I had hated the very idea of a god because of how awful the world is. But she wasn't mad at me, or any of us. There was just this feeling of infinite understanding, infinite love, and compassion.

246,"Have you ever wondered why it is that we use metaphors of illumination in religious language to convey high attainments of moral insight? Why we depict saints and bodhisattvas (and tellingly, luminaries) in iconography with halos and auras? On one level, this is more obviously a metaphor for [saliency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salience_(neuroscience)), for attracting attention toward what is most relevant and necessary for survival and thriving. But this impulse has even deeper evolutionary origins, and it speaks to something fundamental about our nature as a diurnal species that developed on a planet with regular day/night cycles. 

It is a harkening back to a much, much more ancient impulse in the emergence of our consciousness, that of phototropism. Many plants, fungi, and simple organisms exhibit this behavior of turning toward the light to aid in their survival. Leaves on trees will turn to optimize their Sun exposure, and mushrooms grow upward out of darkness toward the Sun. This is likely a trait that we have had with us from the very beginning, before we had any of the senses that we now take for granted, all the way back to when the first photosensitive cells emerged and conferred adaptive advantage over those who were still employing random motility as their best strategy for survival. For billions of years, we have struggled toward the light. 

The reason that the Sun feels good upon our face, and the reason that Jesus is the Light of the World, or that Buddha is the Enlightened One, are more tightly related than we tend to think. Even in High Abstraction, we can find biological roots, and it is interesting to consider that had the conditions of the solar system been any different in the emergence of life, what sort of religious metaphors would have emerged from those conditions?",Phototropism and enlightenment,religion

Christians, on the other hand, are very enthusiastic about spreading their faith.

What I find curious though is that the stories from the Christian Old Testament all seem to encourage evangelizing to other peoples.  And these are stories that all Abrahamic faiths share.

From Elijah to Daniel, they were all more actively trying to spread their faith to other people.

- When it comes to Joseph Smith though; he was a real person. A photo of him was recently unearthed. More importantly though, there is evidence of his message. How? Simple - 11 additional people, plus Joseph and Emma Smith, all claimed to see the plates. Despite many of them having a falling out; not one of them ever recanted his testimony. Even after Smith's death. Even on their deathbed; none of them recanted the existence of the golden plates. That to me shows something",Is Mormonism the faith with the most evidence?,religion

10,"I am a 25 year old agnostic atheist from Canada who was raised without religion. I am autistic and I have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and my fear of the possibility of an afterlife has consumed me for years. This post is mainly about Christianity because it is the predominant faith in my geographical area, however if there is an existing deity from another faith that features hell, such as Islam, and the Islamic God is reading this, I am so sorry and I know that I am stupid and worthless and I will try my best to be convinced of the correct religion.

I have extended family members who have told me that I will be tortured in hell for eternity because I am not convinced of three same faith as them. They are devout Evangelical Christians. The fear of hell has been in my mind for about 5 years now and the thought of any kind of eternal consciousness scares me more than anything. Why does anything in my life matter if I might exist in a state of torture for billions and billions of years and infinitely longer than that? And why does this depend on which religion I am convinced of if I cannot consciously choose what I am convinced of? It would be wrong and disingenuous to say ""Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior"" or ""There is not God but God and Muhammad (pbuh) is the final messenger of God"" because I don't know how to evaluate those statements, and I simply don't know how I can become convinced of any spiritual view when there will always be religious academics who are way smarter than me who think I'm going to deserve to be tortured for eternity for a different reason.

Furthermore, if Christianity is real, I know that Thomas Aquinas said that people in heaven will rejoice at seeing non-believers in hell. I have spent so much time crying, self-harming, and obsessing over this. I hope so much that Christianity isn't real because the thought of being a Christian and going to heaven and being happy that people, including loved ones, are being tortured for eternity is so incredibly upsetting that I don't know how someone can be a Christian and be happy. I apologize if this is offensive, and if there is a deity, I am so sorry for not being convinced of the existence of the correct deity. I am stupid and God wanted me to know it by making me autistic and useless.

Please tell me what I can do to avoid hell, but also understand that I might not be convinced of what you tell me because there will always be endless people to tell me of their religious views, which may contradict yours, and I am not smart enough to evaluate which are true. Thank you. I apologize sincerely if I have offended anyone.

18,"The arguments I hear from these types are nearly always limited to conceptual, linguistic points such as ""I've never met God"" or ""The burden of proof is on the believer."" 

But some traditions - Buddhism, Kriya Yoga - talk of God or the supernatural as something our limited organs have been conditioned to filter out so we focus on survival and not supernatural things. Language is one of those filters. It is a mistake in these traditions to think only that which can be stated in language is true, because language is a mere human convention that never fully captures an experience, and is thus always misleading.

Then there's Maharaj Ji and peoples experiences with him. I'm curious how nonbelievers view these accounts - are they misguided, tricked, or is this the proof of the supernatural you ask for?

24,"I've been noticing a spate of posts and comments attempting to proselytizing a religion, sometimes overtly in the form of comments like, ""You should become a Muslim"" or ""You need to accept Jesus"". In fact, proselytizing has become the second most frequent rule violation in /r/religion after violations of Reddiquette (Rule 4 if you're on New Reddit). Sometimes these efforts to proselytizing have been a bit more covert, arguing that a certain religion has to be the only true religion, with it being implied that you therefore need to join it, or sometimes asking people to make a sales pitch for their religion. 

By the same token, we've also seen a lot of posts and comments that might be described as ""counter-proselytizing"", advising people against certain religions. While I appreciate that we might all admire our own religions more than any other, that's no reason to go discouraging people in their pursuit for spiritual fulfillment. 

So please keep in mind that we have a strict ""No proselytizing"" rule (Rule 7), applicable to both overt, covert, and counter proselytizing.

Additionally, books are subject to changes and revisions by human scribes who are trying to ""help"". Instead, an efficient god would simultaneously send a message into everyone's brains. Kind of like a software developer sending out a software update to all computers in the network, or like a mass email being sent to every employee of a company.

26,"Just think about it. Take the 3 main Abrahamic faiths.
If you're an agnostic and have no bias for any religion, then there is only 1 truth.
If you're a Muslim, you HAVE to reject jesus as God and accept Muhammed as a prophet.
If you're a Christian, you HAVE to reject Muhammed as a prophet and accept jesus as God.
If you're Jewish, you have to reject jesus as God and both Jesus/Muhammed as prophets.

These are facts.
So you can never say every religion gets you to heaven, because the moment you accept and follow any particular religion by default you HAVE to reject the rest. If you don't, then you do not belong in either of them.

Which of these 3 is valid according to me? 
Based on my research it's Islam. There are plenty of logical reasons why but 1 fact is undeniable.
Its preservation of scripture.
Take a step back and access the reality. Who today has seen the real jesus, moses and muhammed? Answer is no one. We assume we know who they are from what we read. Just because some random preacher gives a sermon it doesn't mean it's the truth because even his information is from scripture.
Once we analyse the scripture, we can decide for ourselves right? Well not really, what if the scripture we have is corrupted, meddled with people later on? Then what we read is never the truth to begin with.
Hence why I believe the Islamic scripture in the Quran stand out from the rest. It's the same as it was when it was revealed. Where are all the other scriptures are copies and translations.

I urge you to do the same research and see regarding preservation of scripture before you decide. Like I said from the start, only 1 is valid.",There is only 1 valid religion.,religion

29,"Hi everyone, I hope I’m in the right place for this kind of post. 

So I come from a huge lineage of Jewish ancestry, Jewish as far back as we can see. I was raised in a somewhat, but not very, religious household. I also attended a Jewish high school. During my adolescence I went through agnosticism and atheism and found myself seeking religion again around the age of 19 or 20. At 22, I consider myself to be Jewish and it’s a huge part of my identity. 

The thing is, I feel a lot of guilt because I don’t follow the organized religion and don’t really want to. I don’t go to Shul, I don’t keep kosher, I sin like crazy. I also have tattoos which is deeply frowned upon. I also, in general, am a believer in science. 

But I still believe in G-d, and I seek so much comfort in that belief. Makes me feel less alone, even though that deity is putting me through the wringer every fckin day. I feel a genuine sense of love and identity with G-d and Judaism

I feel like a hypocrite, so I wanted to ask if it’s possible to really love G-d without following the rules, so to speak.",Is it possible to believe in and love G-d without following the religion at all?,religion

Now I’m an adult with anxiety and I don’t know what to believe. 

Before you say “God gives us free will to choose” if the only options are 
1. Believe in Jesus and go to paradise
2. Don’t believe in Jesus and suffer for eternity

Then that’s not a choice, that’s an ULTIMATUM! That is COERCION.

And don’t tell me that “hell is just a state of separation from God” because **Jesus literally says Hell is place of everlasting torment in Matthew 13**

But then every major world religion has a Hell that you go to if you don’t follow their teachings.

The Quran says faith and good deeds prevent Hell.

The Bible says only believing Jesus died for your sins prevents Hell.

Buddhist teachings say that only following Buddhist teachings prevent being reincarnated into Hell (and yes I checked, Buddhism does have a torture realm called Naraka. But at least theirs isn’t permanent.

So my questions are
1. Why would a God who is the source of love make a place beyond even the hope of redemption? A billion years 

2. Why would a supreme being make faith SO RISKY. It’s practically a dice roll. If he wants to save us from Hell, why wouldn’t he make it more than obvious. And if it was obvious, why isn’t everyone in the world one faith?

you will become the King.

Starting back at my freshman year of highschool, I began to practice Wicca. I had a very strong faith and felt in touch with myself and the universe. My faith followed me through the military and I had no issues until a few years back. 

I shared my faith with my wife until she moved to christianity. She stated that it was a hard choice and she was almost scared to talk to me about it because she knew how I felt about christianity. I re-assured her that there was no issue. Over time she chipped away at me to give it a try until I was utterly unstable in my faith.

So in a fit of frustration I burned my BOS and gave away my gems, books, and tools. I told her I would try, even though I didn't want to.
I spent the next 3 years miserable and being gaslit by a whole community into feeling like I was utterly worthless unless I was a perfect christian. I eventually told her how unhappy I was and that I will no longer be identifying as a christian.

So now I'm here. I spent soooo much time looking into proof of the falsehoods of christianity that it's hard now for me to get into any kind of spirituality. I can't seem to get back into my old faith because of the new found views of how the universe works.

103,"1. **C.S Lewis'** ***The Great Divorce*** **(1945)** **is a small book full of big ideas**. It describes a bus ride from hell to heaven, and the stories of the ghosts who are onboard. This short book has insightful things to say about how art and inquiry get corrupted, the nature of hell, and more👇
2. **2. Marriage - or Divorce?** Blake wrote about the ""Marriage of Heaven and Hell"" - Lewis writes about their divorce. Lewis thinks the difference between heaven and hell can't be overcome through some ""development, adjustment, or refinement.""
3. **Lewis doesn't believe different moral choices are like ""radii of a circle"" where they all eventually meet in the center**. Instead, each choice is a fork in the road, and the final destination of two people making different choices actually grows further apart over time.
4. **Describing hell = expanding hell.** Lewis writes the ""curious wish to describe Hell"" is an attempt to *expand* hell. Relentless complaining, permanent dissatisfaction, a refusal to ever acknowledge truth or beauty - these are the acts of salesmen of hell.
5. **Where do opinions come from?** Lewis asks if our opinions are ""honestly come by."" More often than not, we absorb - and then project - beliefs only because they seem ""modern and successful.""
6. **How NOT to deal with the past.** One of the ghosts in the novel is clinging onto her past. She says: ""The past was all I had."" But to embalm and freeze the past for eternity - like an Egyptian mummy - is the ""wrong way to deal with sorrow.""
7. **The spirit of inquiry,** ***corrupted.*** The spirit of inquiry is meant to lead to answers, not to an addiction to questions. A ghost compares questions to travelling: ""To travel hopefully is better than to arrive."" But then, without a destination, ""how could anyone travel hopefully?""
8. **The subversion of art.** The origin of good art is simple: the artist catches ""glimpses of Heaven"" somewhere, and puts it down on paper or canvas. But when a love of the medium takes precedence over heavenly inspiration, the artist - and her art - is lost.
9. **A misuse of pity.** Pity's proper role is to be ""a spur that drives joy to help misery."" But pity is often wrongly *inverted*. Lewis writes: ""Those who choose misery can hold joy up to *ransom*, by pity. "" Pity can be the invisible chain the miserable use to control the joyous.
10. **Bottom line.** Lewis writes the difference between hell and heaven is one of kind and not of degrees. Hell is where the spirit of inquiry is corrupted into endless questioning, where art is without inspiration, and where pity is used as an excuse to spread misery.

We are conditioned to believe that life's questions are complicated and ""God's will"" can't be understood. But if it can't be understood, does that make it crazy or irrational? The most brilliant minds on earth often say that if you can't explain a topic to a child then you don't real understand it, and aren't we ""God's children."" I do look around, after years of being atheist and think that this all cannot be randomness that there is something behind life, but I do not think highly at all of that thing. It's all the same reasons that I didn't believe in a creator before that I believe in one now, my problem was I kept trying to justify what I was conditioned to, that the creator loves us and has a plan. But when there is a crazy, irrational, evil, or narcissistic creator, it isn't complicated or difficult to justify. They make us as sinners and make us repent for it and worship them, we can never be as good as them and must spend eternity serving them, isn't that very narcissistic? To intentionally create an entire species make them flawed and tell them the only way to make up for it is through blind faith? Sickness, pain, and suffering are also unnecessary. What ""good"" being would want that. The people who say there is a duality, ""you can't have good without evil."" Even if that were true ""god"" would have had to create that duality by their logic. Even in order to carry on your own existence, no matter who or what you are you must inflict pain onto another living thing, that is savage.

152,"(This is a loose association of various ideas I’ve been thinking about for a while that I’m curious to know what others think of. My apologies if it lacks a little in coherence.)

I have long been fascinated by the cases in Nature of parasites which have the ability to alter the brain chemistry and behavior of their host to increase their own reproductive fitness. Many of you have no doubt seen the footage of the (cordyceps fungus)[https://youtu.be/XuKjBIBBAL8] and the way it hijacks insects’ nervous systems to increase its propagation. There are other examples, and at least one that we know of that effects humans, *toxoplasma gondii*. It begins its life parasitizing rodents, but can only complete its reproductive cycle within the guts of cats. It has evolved to hijack the brains of rodents to make them disinhibited to the scent of cats, so that they will be more easily eaten. In humans, it has been correlated with a number of psychiatric conditions, most tellingly the behavior of cat hoarding. Which makes sense; more cats = more hosts, more vectors for transmission. 

Our lived experience and conceptualization of ourselves, typically, is that we are a unified entity; an ego. A voice in our head that we assume is “us”, mentating, interpreting events, making decisions, etc. Much of modern insights in neuroscience, cognitive science, abnormal psychology etc seem to validate the ancient insights of the Buddhists, that this sense of self is an illusion. The psychoanalysts, beginning with Freud, also started to conceptualize the self as more of a battlefield of competing spirits or personalities, each with their own aims and motivations, that the mind overlays with a post-hoc rationalization of being a singular entity. 

There is a burgeoning field of research into the nature of the human gut biome, the ecology of microorganisms living in our digestive tracts, and its role in influencing the levels of neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin. The health of this biome, and its healthy regulation of serotonin, seems largely dependent upon the quality of our diet. I think of it like a garden; what we eat creates the conditions of certain things to grow. If we have unhealthy diets, this creates the conditions for a less symbiotic biome, which then influences our brains at a neurochemical level, which produce cravings for the foods that are less beneficial to us, but more beneficial to them. 

So this seems to have some role in depression, as a depressive state is highly stressful, physiologically; it shortens time horizons so that caring for long term wellbeing becomes impossible, the need for short term and detrimental pleasure as an escape from existential pain becomes imperative, and the energy to cook and eat healthy is so sapped, that cheap and heavily processed foods become the default diet. Which creates a feedback loop with the gut biome, cultivating the conditions that produce the microorganisms that desire more of the same food and influence serotonin to prolong the depression. 

Enter the psychedelics, which increasing research is showing to have truly miraculous effects on treating depression. A lot of this probably has a lot to do with the structural similarity of molecules like DMT and psilocin to endogenous serotonin. But studies have also shown that both plant medicines, particularly in the case of Ayahuasca, that they also have anti-parasitic effects. As Ayahuasca emerged within a jungle environment that had its fair share of native parasites that humans had to deal with, for whatever other benefits this medicine had, it likely played a vital role in treating parasitic infection. 

All of this to say: I wonder if many of the demons and malevolent spirits that traditional cultures the world over have described are insights into the subtle influences that parasitic agents can have on human being.","The Spirit of Gravity: Depression as a Demon, and Demons as Parasites",religion

159,"Something that confuses me about self-identified believers is their insistence on certainty. They want to prove that their religion is correct and that their god exists. That history indicates they are correct. That scripture indicates they are right. That they never have doubts — and that if they have doubts, it’s a moral failing on their part. 

But faith is belief without proof, and it’s an essential part of being a mature human regardless of religious affiliation (e.g. a student must believe he has the ability to learn, even if he has no proof, in order to learn). And I think religion can do a beautiful job teaching faith — that is its realm. And doubt is such an important part of faith, as the latter cannot exist without the former. 

Therefore, it makes me sad to see such an emphasis on certainty and proof in religious folks who completely miss the transformational power of spirituality — all in favor of justification for their belief system or tribe. 

Of course I’ve met spiritually mature people of all faiths who understand this greatly. But I feel the average Christian (as that is the dominant religion in my part of the world) doesn’t understand this at all — and would find what I just said greatly offensive despite it being part of their deeper theological canon.

I’ve wanted to get baptized, get my daughter baptized, but I’m not sure what I even believe in or how to go about getting started with a church.. and to complicate matters, this past week I opened up about being abused, and then a few days later found out the person who abused me as a child just passed away less than a week later, and I feel guilty and disgusting to feel relieved and happy, like God did this for me rewarding for coming clean, I feel guilty being “happy” he’s getting the punishment he deserves.. what kind of person would be happy to learn someone died or is suffering???

189,"I’m fairly versed in the various schools of Luciferian and Satanist thought and their philosophies/theologies. Some of the more popular variants don’t have much in their ethos and praxis that I would find terrible objectionable. But there is something about the more modern rebranding of the archetype of Satan, and its appeal to people, that I have a hard time understanding. 

Say you were an alien anthropologist, studying a particular culture. This culture has, over thousands of years, developed a symbol to represent the essence of evil, the set of motivations and actions that warp an individual character into producing malevolent suffering, deceptive manipulation, and violent subjugation. For many generations, it is widely understood, if not fully rationally, what this symbol means, and that there is a moral imperative to aspire to the opposite of what it represents. 

So my issue is, knowing that, why would you adopt such a symbol with such a historical consensus of meaning, even if in modern times that symbol has been rebranded by some to have a different meaning? 

I understand that there are behaviors and people and even whole groups that have been erroneously lumped into this category of evil, historically. And that it has been used to project one’s own unconscious malevolence onto others. But is that enough to ignore the insights of generations of artists, mystics and thinkers on the characterological makeup of the personality of evil?",I’m wondering if the Satanists here can help me better understand something,religion

209,"Hey guys! I made a similar post in my religion's sub but got little to no response so thought I should try here...I would be happy for anyone to help me understand but I guess this might resonate more with someone from an Abrahamic faith? 

I have always struggled to figure out how God's hukam (His will) comes into play in our lives. Unfortunately talking to family members has only confused me further because their reasoning is quite circular.

From my understanding, God is All-Powerful and All-Knowing, and everything happens within His will. So does that include people who stray further or closer to their faith? Or those who leave religion? Or say, a man sexually abusing a small child, these things also happen according to Him?

Or the last for example, does that happen because evil does not happen as per His will, it happens because humans have 'free will'. But I never understood this also because the man has free will in that situation to sexually abuse a small helpless child, but the small child's free will has been breached because she was sexually abused?! Or is this all a part of His will too? I cannot though, wrap my head around an All-Powerful, All-Knowing entity allowing it to happen. Or worse, willing it to happen.

I hope my thoughts and question did not offend, I have just been really struggling with this entire concept and the only answers I'm ever given are 'God and his ways are beyond our understanding and comprehension' or 'we cannot question our Creator's will' or something along these lines and such answers genuinely make no sense to me :/ And I am sorry I know this question is really asked to death but I'd really like help in understanding how people wrap their head around this concept especially in the context of the examples I have, please.

234,"The story of Cain being associated to vegetables, and Abel to meat is interesting. More interesting is how God favored Abel's over Cain's sacrifice. Meat over vegetables, and how Cain killed Abel. [Some experts believe this explains the transition from hunters and gathers, to farming.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/cain-abel-reflects-bronze-age-rivalry)

First humans were hunter gathers (Abel). They did probably have some pro-agriculture to feed animals that they later eaten. Those animals were less likely to be part of a farm, but rather domestic horses or just animals living freely around to be later hunted. Protein was their main source of energy. They had to be top fit humans to survive and hunt. It was a hard life, but it indeed provided meat, which is the most nutrient dense food by far. That life selected for best intelligence, genes and health.

Slowly, hunter gatherers were replaced by farmers (Cain), who started eating mostly grains and vegetables. They also transformed the free environment so hunting and gathering was not as profitable. 

Farming produced mostly carbs, which replaced most protein sources. Humans moved to carbs as the main source of energy. We today have cavities because our teeth have not adapted yet to our farmer high carb diet. That also explains our obesity. Indeed, ""God"" favored the hunter's diet as we evolved on it. We probably became smarter aa a spexies as we developed better ways to hunt and gather.

Cain over Abel explains how weaker, protein deficient farmers took over. Carbs were cheap and abundant at the cost of some protein nutrition. Farmers won by numbers and changed the environment to their own benefit. They still had domestic animals as protein, but also they did not have to struggle much anymore. Food became anither commodity.

Civilization was born and now weak people had a greater change to survive too. Many strong people felt lost and out of place, replaced. We sacrificed Abel for Cain's good. We sacrificed some high quality individuals for the greatest good or most individuals, even if not optimal health for them all.

God only favored Abel in the sense we evolved to be Abel. Cain was a rebellion against that nature.

It is weird this polity is not used to explain the unprecedented success of Christianity in Europe, but also in Asia and Africa for a few centuries. After all, organization is very important for a religion to persist and thrive. Maybe this organization gave Christianity and edge.

Other religions such as Islam also had their own systems but it seems did not copy Chistianity on this aspect. I also failed to see the precedent of this polity in Judaism.

I believe it is a robust system because it is a combination of hierachy (under bishops) and decentralization (bishops themselves), so it gets the best of both worlds. Even when rites have been reformed, the system has persisted with little changes, it seems. 

It is also biblical, which suggest it came to be a few decades after Jesus, if we do not consider the system of apostles established by Jesus  as proto-epicopalian:

Except for the cultural shock of introducing another religion, I often find it good that missionaries introduce a writting system for those people to write down their cultural contribution, and basic education such as math. After all, by just interacting with the West they are doomed to lose part of their culture anyway, so Christianity can give an introduction to the West, at least partially.

Some people say that we shall do that of introducing education fit to the culture, but in a secular way. After all, many outsiders use the ignorance of natives in tribes to make unfair trades and rip them off, so at least they need some math and education to deal with that. The issue is that there are really not many secular missions trying to educate natives that want to get into the world and trade. So missionaries took that niche.

More ironic is that governments have far more money to help natives get educated on math and create a writting yet they do not use for it, so many younger natives enter the western world in a huge disadvantage.

Let's examine this life being a school narrative: Let’s say you’ve gone through high school and came out with an average grade, and once asked if you could’ve done better you said: “yes, I could’ve!” And then they injected you with ZIP to give you complete amnesia so that you don’t remember anything that you've learned over the last 4 years where they’ll throw you into high school over and over again when you graduate. Let’s say according to this hypothetical, you also regress your learning progress each time. Now wouldn’t it make more sense if when you get down with high school you get an opportunity to keep some or all of your memories from high school? Which one do you think would benefit you as a learning experience? The one where they gave you complete amnesia each time or the one where you brought some or all of the knowledge back from the last 4 years? Surely it would be a better learning experience with some of the memories back at least since you’ve already gone through many mistakes before that you wouldn't have to do again whereas if you were thrown in it with full amnesia each time, then how are you learning anything? Especially when we consider the cases where people reincarnate thousands of times to learn the same lesson like William Buhlman talks about in his books, that would be considered the worst school in existence if it can’t teach something for over thousands of lifetimes. If one can’t learn it over thousands of lifetimes, surely they can never “learn” whatever they are trying to learn right? Do you smell the scheme I am smelling here?

If the afterlife is full of love, why are we here to learn love? If people can experience others' lives on Akashic records, why can we not do that to learn lessons? Why does it have to take hundreds or in some cases thousands of lifetimes to learn something? Why is it always “you have to do it just one last time” with these guides? What do the majority of people learn by using their most productive times getting mostly drained from going to schools and jobs they hate in order to survive (mostly by eating other sentient beings who did not want to suffer and die) in a world full of pain, suffering and unexplainable evil?

Wars, genocides, pain, sickness, pedophiles, rapists, homeless people, starving kids, child sacrifices, corruption, countries like North Korea, factory pollution, 150 billion animals that are killed every year for human consumption, the system/governments somehow not caring about karma but telling us to care about it, free energy being suppressed (where we are blamed for the alternative), historic narratives that repeat themselves over and over, thousands of religions with full of lies about our very existence which caused the biggest number of deaths on earth, how humanity does not have a shelter itself at birth when coming here, drug addictions, murder, plaque, deception, lies, mind control, indoctrinations since childhood, the whole realm being deceptive/evil/demonic but them saying it's our fault, human body seemingly engineered for suffering and brainwashing, psychopaths that rule over the majority of people, fear and negativity pumped from news 7/24 etc. I mean what the heck is going on here!?! Why they haven't shut this place down already or at a minute fixed it? How does this mess belong in a good school, or in the resume of a loving God? Why are these things never talked about in near-death experiences or pre-birth memories by the supposed council of elders or by the guides and gods?

What ""loving"" God would make a world where our most innate driving goal is survival at all cost but our only guarantee is death? Just because there are things we can learn here doesn't make it a learning ground and for the record, I'd learn much better if I wasn't under stress inside an amnesia suffering realm and that I wasn't mind-wiped into unlearning everything that I've learned, just to relearn them again in a reincarnation loop of madness while the (fake) spirit guides and gods who convinced me to reincarnate here get to enjoy afterlife without getting reincarnated anywhere. Why do we need to forget everything and agree on reincarnation/getting mind-wiped right away after death anyway? To make us forget all of the evil sufferings we’ve been put through that didn’t make any sense? Oh, and why the more I learn the more negative things I end up discovering as well? What's up with that? Yeah, I'd say **THIS IS the bad place…**

But Jesus is going to save us right? Save us from what though, wasn't there supposed to be a loving creator? Why are we in a hellish realm that we need to be saved from, to begin with? God saying we need to be saved is almost like admitting that there is a tyrannical thing in control that we need saving from.

21,"I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.  


Hello.  My life I have been raised as a Protestant Christian.  However, as I've grown up, I've questioned my beliefs and what I was taught.  I try my best to balance my religious views, as I do love Christ and God the Father both, with what is logical, and what evidence exists (usually based on science.)  Recently, I've even been branching out and studying Islam.  I've always been interested in other cultures, and of course with that comes Religion.  Recently however, I was introduced to The Book of Mormon.  I've read this book (not all of it), and I'm still mostly against believing it, but not entirely.  I also know that the Catholic Bible has 46 books of the Old Testament, while the Protestant Bible that I grew up with has 39, a difference of 7 books of the bible.  I have seen Bibles that include the Book of Mormon, used sometimes within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints I visited, and I was wondering, though very unlikely as the branches of the Latter Day Saint movement usually follow the Protestant Bible, if there existed a Bible that included all 46 books of the Catholic Old Testament, all 27 books of the New Testament, and all 15 books of the Book of Mormon?

38,"Ok so here's where it all started:

Right so I grew up a Muslim and my parents practiced the religion their whole lives and have tried to teach me everything about it.

The theology, beliefs, the Quran, hadiths, everything. Day after day, I was just practicing the religion normally as I should. But especially when I was a kid, I remember watching these cartoons about the stories of the prophet and being so engaged in them that I completely adopted the ideology and mindset of a typical Muslim. 

Whenever someone mentioned Jesus, I was would say stuff in my head like, ""No he wasn't the son of God, the trinity is a lie yada yada"". I grew pretty knowledgeable about it until covid hit. I grew detached more from my religion and as I got older, I would spend more time using tech and doing typical teen things. 

But last year, I was using Reddit and came across some this subreddit and a few other subreddits basically pointing out the flaws in my religion. At first I felt offended and shocked, I grew to ""see"" their logical and rational arguments. The more and more I saw things regarding LGBTQ rights and gender equality, I became very detached to the point I thought I left the religion. I kept going back and forth with my family asking questions and talking to them.

I remember I was talking to family about dogs, pork, pre-marital relationships or LGBTQ rights and I remember crying a lot that night. But as time passed on I've learnt to accept it and everytime someone mentions these things or anything religion prohibits, my ears keep close attention to what they're saying.


I've seen posts about how people have committed apostasy and felt elated after years of indoctrination and suffering but I don't know if that's the right path I should take.

 Also I've been getting into philosophy and politics recently so I've been looking for some good books to read, just ones don't make my brain fry due to the extreme usage of descriptive vocabulary:)",I have doubts about my religion but I'm not sure leaving will be the best decision,religion

59,"Hi everyone, never posted here and not sure if this would be an appropriate place, but I want to try at least.

TLDR: my husband said he converted today, and I'd like advice on how to be supportive and more comfortable with it while I remain atheist. 

My husband and I have been together for a total of 8 years, and one of the things we bonded over when we first started our relationship was being atheist.

Today he told me he has converted. He's been going through a lot recently, and has taken to reading the Bible the past few days. I feel like it has brought him some comfort, and has made him want to improve his life in some aspects. He has been involved with religion before when he was a kid, his family even was part of a cult before, so I know this is not new to him. 

In a way, it does make me a little uncomfortable, because I personally do not believe in it, BUT I do not want to stop him from believing what he wishes, especially if it brings him comfort and helps him improve his life. Does anyone have some advice on how I can be supportive of him without going against my own personal beliefs or feeling uncomfortable about it? 

This is a little difficult, because while on the inside I feel a little uncomfortable by it, I do not want it to impact our relationship and dont want to make him uncomfortable too. I love him to death, and I still want to be there for him. I don't want to judge him for what he believes, but at the same time I can't help but to do that. I don't want to make him feel bad or make him feel like he can't talk to me about it if he wants to though. 

Basically, any advice on how to be supportive, or feel more comfortable with the idea would be appreciated!

Meanwhile I also hear many devout believers say they choose to believe every day, trust God, work for God, leap of Faith, etc.

That’s another reason why most Hindus or other Indian religions don’t evangelise/proselytise.

Imagine if you went to a different country/region and asked the people there to live by your culture. They would probably think “no, we are not from your country,, we have our own traditions and values”

Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Buddhism etc is part of Indian culture. Unless someone wants to adopt it, why we want them to?

Like you wouldn’t tell a foreigner to live by your culture just because you do?

So, we don’t tell people to adopt our traditions - unless they want to. They are ours.

I find it strange and very rude that people would want to convert others to their religion. It's extremely condescending and disrespectful that some people want everyone in the world to join their religion. One of the things that makes this world great, in my opinion, is different cultures, faiths and traditions - if you erase all but one, that takes a lot of the beauty of humanity away.

You might say that in some religions, they have a command to spread their faith - this is true, but I say that it goes against the teaching that lots of religions have, which is respect, and respect should, in my view, is more important than how many people you have in your religion. The number of people you have in your religion, does not make it more true. That would be an ad populum fallacy, also known as appeal to popularity.

You also might say that people try to convert people to save them from torture. Well, if that sort of theology is true, I would question if that belief comes from God or humans, and would still not want to convert people. I

123,"A quotation I heard recently, on the Weird Studies podcast:

&gt; ‘The problem with displacing the
supernatural ""back"" into the realm of
psychology… is that it remains precisely that: only a displacement. The unearthliness, the charisma, the
devastating noumenon of the supernatural is conserved. One cannot speak in the end it seems to me, of a ""decline in magic"" in
post-Enlightenment Western culture, only perhaps its relocation within the new empire of subjectivity itself .. But the effect was to demonize the world of thought. We have yet to explore very deeply the social, intellectual, and existential implications of the act of demonization.'

In fact there is a joking meme in Pentecostal groups... our theology and favorite theologians and many preachers are almost always Baptists, and yet we are Pentecostals. I expected other denominations to do the same as Pentecostals are specially conservative, socially and theologically (not traditionally, though).

This is why always cringe when people claim Protestant denominations hate each other. There are some serious disagreements, but in most common grounds we are able to form non-denominational groups in colleges, schools, internet groups, etc. with no problem.

I wonder if other religions are so flexible in this aspect. Do non-Orthodox Jews invite Orthodox rabbis? Is that even possible or the Synagogue's structure does not allow such thing? Do Sunnis and Shias form non-denominational Islamic groups?

- **Aesthetics.** Societies often put the best of their art and architecture in religion. Even non-traditional religions such as Protestantism, often use the best artistic tools of the current culture to worship God and help the community. A lot of the classic buildings and paintings we love were inspired by religion and spirituality.

- **Ethics.** Of course most of the controversies on religion opposing abortion, gay marriage, etc. are ethical issues, but most of religious values often make sense: No stealing, no murder, no lying, love your family and parents, forgive enemies, helping others, etc. Atheists are right that we do not need religion for those values, but it is useful for most people to have those values centralized in an organization and community such as a Church, and its tradition and authority also helps many people to respect such values.

- **Community.** Religious communities are ideal for families meeting new people, interacting with the community and enjoying other people's company. Most other social environment are very sexual or drug orientes, such as bars and clubs. Other places are more practical and temporal, such as schools. Religion often gives a reason for different people to meet.

- **Spirituality.** Religion has enough spirituality for most people to follow it. Even rigid traditionalist religions often give a space and time for prayer and worship.

Judaism and Islam have denominations with many differences, and I also understand there are probably more Christian denominations, but it seems that the difference among Christian denominations is still very prominent.

I think the main reason is that Jesus basically let the Apostles organize as they wanted Jesus did not care so much about it. We see multiple examples of this in the Gospels: Jesus give the task and let Apostles organize themselves to do the task as they see fit. The issue is that the rest of the New Testament does not give much instructions about rites either, even in St. Paul's writings.

I guess that if Jesus and St. Paul did not care so much about this it means it is not so important for Salvation in the first place, which would imply Christians shall welcome the diversity of Denominations and rituals, even given the fact it has some obvious downsides.","Why are Christian rites so different among denominations, compared to denominations of Judaism and Islam?",religion

American Evangelical Christians, however, seem oblivious to this, probably because Jews were never prosecuted in USA as much as in Europe and Asia. Of course, anti-Semitism was never limited to Christianity, and most antisemitism today probably come from Islamic countries rather than Christianity, but the history is there and it is perfectly reasonable to understand why Jews in America often vote Left, while they also support Israel, which is very nationalistic and even right wing. This suggest that American Jews just dislike Christians for theological and historical reasons rather than politics; no problem so far, they are entitled to that.

My understanding is that Evangelical theology sees Israel as key to prophetic fulfillment, but this idea is relatively new. American Evangelicals are not like European and Canadian Evangelicals, who are very neutral about Israel. Evangelicals can support Jewish people as they support other groups, without supporting Israel, just as most Liberals and non-American Christians do.

Some people love to say that religion is no different from cults. In a sense, they are right, and indeed many religions started as cults. However, I believe the main difference is on the social and political structure of religions and cults.

Cults are often more centralized on a living leader or founder. Cults often require ""donations"" to join them rather than being voluntary such as in most religions. Most of those donations are immovable goods rather than time or money such as in religion.

On top of this is the fact that cults have also greater benefits than religions for joining. You often get a place, a position and role in the community, etc. People focus too much on the negative of cults, but forget that people join cults because the positive, which sells well in an increasingly isolated society.

189,"Note: This post does not attempt to be political. It seems religion dying in the West is just setting a space to new ideas to rise, and one of the is Progressivism. It is interesting to notice that this idea is often slightly related to Christianity, either as a response to it or as a secular continuation of Christian values.

Many progressive values seem to be an exaggerated interpretation of New Testament values:
 - Loving thy neighbor most progressive values and rights are based on empathy and sympathy, and equality.
 - Forgiving your enemies... most liberal policy is about decriminalizing stuff, reducing punishment, less jails, etc.
 - Loving God over all... they often do not believe in God, but it seems they see Human Rights in his place. Often questioning Human Rights such as equality has the same consequences as questioning God in the Middle Ages: losing job, ostracism, etc. even when in theory they do believe Rights can be questioned.
 - Doing what is right, regardless of what the government says or prosecution... I think Christians did this but also Progressives practiced civil disobedience.
 - Soul transcending body... this is manifested in the Gender theory as Gender is regarded as higher to define identity, than Birth Sex.
 - Confession... It seems therapy is becoming a form of secular confession, and mental health is often used as synonymous to spirituality.
 - Sin... they claim to not believe in sin, but indeed there are some transgressions that progressive cannot even forgive on any measure, such as racism or sexism.
 - Progressives often do not believe in the afterlife, but do believe science will be able to make us live forever or somehow we will be able to upload consciousness to a computer, transhumanism. This idea is problematic as we do not know what consciousness it and I doubt it can be encoded in ""data"", but who knows.
 - Faith over acts... it seems doing evil is often more forgivable than being evil in the Progressive word. For example, progressives may want to forgive drug users that killed someone under drugs, or teens that did violent crimes while they were younger, but not forgive people who claim to be member of the KKK, for example, even if their crime was less bad in the law.

I have to point out that this is not good or bad. It just seems that people are being told that they are just leaving religion behind, while in fact it seems some aspects of religion have just been rebranded under Progressive ideas. Of course I do not believe Progressivism is a religion (yet I do believe it may evolve into one, although unlikely), but it acts as such in some aspects, just as today the state manages marriage while in the past was just a religious promise.

Human psychology has not changed much since Ancient Times, and assuming we are ""leaving behind religion"" is dangerous as we are made unaware that we may just be accepting a new faith in a more subtle way. We just developed more complex terms and institutions for them, but in the end, the key is to feed our monkey mind's niches.

200," 

We all know that the human race is only a blip on a cosmic timeline. The universe has been there for 13.7 billion years while humans only arrived some 200,000 years ago. The universe might as well extend billions of years into the future after human existence is wiped due to some obvious and inevitable cosmic events such as the sun becoming a white dwarf.

To put this in perspective, if we compress the age of the universe into a day then humans have only existed for less than a second. This puts a fundamental restriction on the amount of knowledge we can ever hope to gain since we only have so much less time to observe the universe. 

Another limitation that humans face when it comes to the acquisition of knowledge is space. Given the vastness of the universe, we can only observe a fraction of the observable universe, not talking about the complete universe. As an example, there might be hundreds of species out there in the universe but we don't know as our access is limited. Sure, the horizon of human knowledge is expanding. But given the vastness and the limited time, can we ever observe a complete universe? The answer is No.

In science, we observe and create models that explain the observations. We, later on, find ways to validate our models. This is the fundamental premise of science. As long as you are faced with phenomena/observations that validate your model, your model is true. But a single observation that invalidates your model is enough to discard the model altogether. In science, we want models that explain what we observe. This has always been the way of science. Hundreds of models/theories were discarded when they failed to explain a given new observation even though they explained some observations for some time. We can find numerous examples of this like atomic models, solar models, etc.

Science in its current state is not the complete truth, and it can never be as long as there is the universe that is unobserved. Yes, science does explain things very well. But it only explains that which we observe and how much universe have we observed? less than one percent! For example, we still don't know exactly what dark matter is and how it is formed even though it is believed to be major part of the universe. Principles of quantum mechanics are still debated, we don't understand the time yet, we have absolutely no idea what are 11 dimensions that string theory proposes and what are they related to and how they affect our reality!

Here's a thought experiment. Suppose humans arrive on earth when the universe has expanded enough that the stars are no longer visible from earth. We only see a black sky during night. Humans evolve and they understand gravity and have discovered the laws of gravity. Now someone comes and proclaims that ""the night sky used to be decorated with tiny little flashing objects"". Everyone would laugh, right? Gravity would not allow that! Those flashing objects will fall to earth! These would be popular arguments. After all that would have been the science of the day!

To further make the point. If you somehow travel back to the Aristotle and tell him that, hey! you know time runs slowly at some points in the universe and you could age slowly! He would make a joke out of you because this is not the standard science during Aristotle. 

Humans evolve and so does their understanding. But I have seen some people take science as absolute truth even though science acknowledges its own limitations. Based on their little knowledge of science, they debate the existence of that which is beyond their comprehension. Not acknowledging your limited knowledge is one form of the ego. We need to acknowledge the basic thing about science. It is entirely dependent on things we can observe, directly or indirectly. 

Here's another thought experiment that can elevate our understanding. Suppose you create a room, create power resources there, build conscious robots, create their chips. You set up the whole room in such a way that all the needs of the robots are fulfilled right there. But you do one basic thing with room. You make sure nothing in the room has ability to fly in air. You completely remove everything that can fly in air, be it dust, insects etc. You also design a bulb that makes round trips around the room every 5 seconds, precisely. 

You let these robots evolve for thousands of years. Now you decide to drop them a message. You tell them about a bird, pigeon, that flies in air and does amazing things in air. All robots laugh!! They say how is this possible! Science does not allow it. They take this as a joking statement. Now is their science valid? for them yes! because that's what they have been observing. Unless a sane robot comes along and decides to ponder deeply and explore the possibility of rooms beyond his room. But that robot is not biased because of what he has been taught as science. 

Some robots ask the question, ""where did we came from?"", ""Is there someone who created us?"". To answer their question, another ""genius'"" robot comes along with answers. He tells them such a being is not possible. He makes some reasonable arguments.

205,"There's a lot that could be covered with this, but I'll keep it simply to two topics that I think about while trying to sleep sometimes.

1: I don't understand why people testifying in court are still offered to swear to tell the truth on a religious symbol, instead of just testifying on their own integrity with an affirmation. It seems archaic to me. It also holds 0 weight for people who are not religious, but can hold weight for people who are. Being seen with a religious item to swear in on just seems, to me, to be an opportunity to gain a certain sway by identifying with something, creating an opening for manipulation. Being religious or not does not make someone a more or less moral person. We're all just humans co-existing in social groups and doing our best.

2: How are the opinions of the few allowed to control the freedoms of the masses? Didn't the founding fathers flee Europe over this? How has it been centuries, literally going from wooden ships and horses, to walking on the moon and global internet, but we can't let go of the need to control others and how they should think/behave, or what rights they have as humans, thinking it's for their own/everyone's good?

While this second one can link to hot topics like Roe vs Wade, would like to not pin things to that point in particular (though as an atheist female I do find it terribly disappointing towards our performance as a species). There have been a lot of laws passed in order to cater towards religious groups over mixed faith regions, which I cannot personally support. If the answer to a 'why' with regard to what someone does to themselves or with a consenting conscious other (so long as it doesn't kill them) falls along the lines of 'because \[higher power\] says so,' or 'because it makes me uncomfortable,' then how is that fair to expect it to be imposed upon another? For example, forbidding gay marriage to me is like a vegan banning meat sales across the entire state, on the grounds that they and their group believe they're doing good for everyone and the planet. they may have good personal reasons, but they are still personal reasons, and having a support group/organization supporting the same thing does not make it all the more valid. It's an opinion, and a personal choice. I'm not a terrible person for enjoying being an omnivore. And I'm not a terrible person for not believing in a higher power (please do not use this to try and convince me to, with all due respect, it's not happening, just like how I would not try to persuade you to not be religious, I'm just trying to explore how 'the other side' thinks).

So, why is there no separation of church and state in the USA yet? Why are human rights not generalized for all, out of respect for humans who seek to be happy at no one else's expense? Do religious people fear that the world would fall into ruin without religion, while atheists are already watching it burn in some ways because of religion? To me, it says a lot more about someone of faith, as an individual and their own integrity, if they think someone needs the fear of \[higher power\] in their life in order to be a good person. These are my thoughts on the matter. I'd like to hear yours. I don't expect everyone to agree/support, and hope no one feels targeted by the above. Would be nice to see how others see these matters, and how they choose to address and phrase it.

208,"I know this question has been asked before. It's just that lately I've been thinking some more about faith and religious belief in general.

The way I see it, there are two main categories of ""things"".  Things external to us like the rest of the universe, and things that are internal (existing in our consciousness) like ideas, concepts, doctrines, etc. Yes, there are many ideas that map to the external reality, but obviously not all ideas do. 

Yeah if idealism or substance dualism is true, that worldview might be incorrect. But I'm assuming that our consciousness resides within our bodies.

So, when considering the truth value of various scriptures and especially historical claims, I think we first have to admit that what we are dealing with is ideas. They are words on a page. In that respect all scriptures start off equal.

But very few people believe in all the scriptures. So if you only believe in your religion's scriptures, it's probably because you believe those ideas are a true map to external reality. Either in sense that the historical events happened as described, or that the doctrines and philosophies are true.

While it would be nice if there was a way to justify those beliefs empirically, specifically from observation of external reality, often faith is the thing that stands proxy for evidence.  So why have faith? 

For me, I grew up as a Christian, like many people do in many religions. And as a teenager I came to my own convictions about it and so on. But today I'm not a Christian because I can't go from ""Hey look at the universe, there *might* be a God"" to ""The Bible is divinely inspired and infallible. Oh and the Christians interpret the O.T. correctly as opposed the Jews, who, you know, wrote it."". 

It's just too many unsupported jumps for me. But I understand if you have faith because life is better for you following your religion than not. I mean, that's the only thing that makes sense to me. But tell me what you think 🤔

216," Murderers, thieves, terrorists and criminals in total, even them are doing good things. And of course I'm not saying they're doing good things in reality, but instead in their mind they're just being ""good""!

 You rarely see a criminal be like: ""I'm going to do bad things, I'm going to murder good people because I'm a bad person."" ISIS members all believed they were being good! 

 What about ourselves?
When we break someone's heart, are we thinking of being bad or we ""justify"" it somehow that they deserved it, because they were being against ""good""?
 Have you seen people who drive, usually tend to blame other drivers on the street instead of themselves? 
 Or when someone cheats on an exam, do they say ""I'm a filthy thief so I'm gonna cheat on exam""?


 There could be some mentally ill people on the other hand that might say they love being bad, they know what's the bad thing is and they choose it. However, while they're confessing of being bad, they're getting good feelings from that, and ""good feelings"" is also a ""good"" thing. Not mentioning that even them are seeing ""being bad"" as a ""justification "" in some ways. ""Justification"" is a good thing.

 Now say we have someone who claims to be all out bad and even if you slap them in the face they'd enjoy. If you slap them for someone else's fault, they're more likely to complain because they think it's against justice and justice is ""good"". You can't find anyone who's like: ""oh I'm loving this injustice right now""; even when they're not the ones who are being oppressed.

 *Some* people who quit from religion (depends on the religion too, there could be stupid religions out there) and those who oppose religion, usually search for reasons and proof that God does not exist. They're less likely to go like: ""God I don't like you and what you say to me, so I just quit and carry on with my life without you"". They won't say such a thing because they would already accept the existence of something ""good"" that they have to follow and is not easy like alcohol or other stuff.

 So sometimes we don't get that kind of easy reward and pleasure by some ""good"". As a result we try to change the reality itself and determine what's good and what's bad instead of opposing the ""good"".


 Then what's the reason?
I think people just cannot deal with the idea of ever being bad. I know it has biological factors_everything does; that's how the material world works with everything being complex leading to small factors! But my point is that why it is like so! Why after all these years of human history, we all have one common thing and that is to go towards the ""good"" no matter it's bad in reality or not!


P.S.

In Islam they call this ""Fitrat"" which can be translated to the word ""nature"". In simple words, it means that God set a default setting for every human that no matter what, they will always follow the ""good"".

Also, if someone has never ever heard of any religion or the word ""God"", they are to follow their ""Fitrat"" and based on that, they will be judged.

- If a person has religious beliefs that do not align with any socially recognized religion, is that person religious?
- If someone accompanies family to church but otherwise is not religious or believers at all, is that person religious?
- If church attendance measures religiosity, what about people who cannot go to church because disabilities or distance? Are they religious? Is religiosity measured like unemployment, when
- In many countries, such as Nordic countries, children often get baptized and get confirmed in the church community, and yet most of them (even often the pastors) are not believers themselves, but see tradition of religion as part of their ""spiritual"" identity (???).
- Another thing I notice is that, overall, communities have decreased in favor of online forums and communication. This is often reflected as less church attendance and therefore less religious, yet some people seem to enjoy theological and spiritual content online, and religious forums. Can that be considered religious attendance in the same way we have nor problem considering tinder as a kind of dating?  
- Some political parties and governments around the glove also ban or discourage religious practices that they do not approve (North Korea, Arabia Saudi, etc.) but other countries still do this in a more subtle way. Can we measure this effect on religiosity? How?

I also observed that in the Americas religiosity by itself seems an identity (by denomination), while in Europe religiosity is very linked to mild Nationalism, and as Nationalism comes and goes, so does religion. In Eastern Asia it seems religion is very personal, to the point they have their own family shrines and house temples. I guess their religiosity cannot be accurately measured as temple assistance, can it?

Even more complex interactions we have in Europe and parts of America, where the less religious or even atheist Higher Class often sends children to private religious schools (???). Maybe they see religion as something positive for their children and not for them? Is this a kind of cultural religiosity?

I know evangelicals who do not see the term ""religious"" in a positive light as they do not accept many traditions of Catholic Christianity, so they do not identify themselves as religious. The crazy thing is that, from the outside, we often consider evangelicals more religious than Catholics. Don't this cause a problem if we ask about religiosity?

Enough for her to ask me to listen to a song about how bad the devil is then suggesting that I should go to church with her to be in the presence of God, as she put it.

Christians in my experience seem to think that the proclamation of their faith is something they can wear like a badge of hounour without actually putting in the work it takes to be Christ-like (which should be the effect of Christianity on a person). The convenience of entry to Heaven (which is clearly the point to them, not actual transformation) because one believes in Jesus Christ, his crucifixion and resurrection, allows many believers a scapegoat when it comes to the moral obligations expected of their faith. 

Most of the people in my life are Christians, a fact that only becomes evident when it helps them in an argument, when an opportunity to virtue signal arises or when they want to judge another sinner for sinning differently.

Stop asking me ""will you tell me how to do my job?"" Stop being so scared of me. I do not judge you or criticize you, nor get angry, or bothered. I am pure love.

Stop asking for forgiveness, there's nothing to forgive. If I made you... I filled you with passions, limitations, pleasures, feelings, needs, inconsistencies... free will. How can I blame you if you respond to something I put in you? How can I punish you for being the way you are, if I'm the one who made you? Do you think I could create a place to burn all my children who behave badly for the rest of eternity? What kind of god would do that?

Respect your peers and don't do what you don't want for yourself. All I ask is that you pay attention in your life, that alertness is your guide.

My beloved, this life is not a test, not a step on the way, not a rehearsal, nor a prelude to paradise. This life is the only thing here and now and it is all you need.

I have set you absolutely free, no prizes or punishments, no sins or virtues, no one carries a marker, no one keeps a record.

You are absolutely free to create in your life. Heaven or hell.

➤ I can't tell you if there's anything after this life but I can give you a tip. Live as if there is not. As if this is your only chance to enjoy, to love, to exist.

So, if there's nothing after, then you will have enjoyed the opportunity I gave you. And if there is, rest assured that I won't ask if you behaved right or wrong, I'll ask. Did you like it? Did you have fun? What did you enjoy the most? What did you learn?...

Stop believing in me; believing is assuming, guessing, imagining. I don't want you to believe in me, I want you to believe in you. I want you to feel me in you when you kiss your beloved, when you tuck in your little girl, when you caress your dog, when you bathe in the sea.

Stop praising me, what kind of egomaniac God do you think I am?

I'm bored being praised. I'm tired of being thanked. Feeling grateful? Prove it by taking care of yourself, your health, your relationships, the world. Express your joy! That's the way to praise me.

Stop complicating things and repeating as a parakeet what you've been taught about me.

What do you need more miracles for? So many explanations?

The only thing for sure is that you are here, that you are alive, that this world is full of wonders.

25,[removed],What is religion? (Definition discussion),religion
26,"This is a concept I've been sketching out for a while but has solidified in my mind after finishing two books: *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari and *The Evolution of God* by Robert Wright.

Both books look into the role religion plays in the evolution of human societies from hunter-gatherer tribes, to chiefdoms, to ancient city-states, to empires, to modern nations.

At every step of the way, religion is there to both reflect mankind's understanding of the world around them as well as advance mankind toward the next stage of civilization.

When you take a high-level view, it becomes pretty clear how it works.

First, let me say that this isn't an opinion on whether religion (or any particular religion) is good or bad, only an observation that it is necessary to achieve civilization as we see it today. However, that is not to say that we might not reach a point at which religion is no longer required for civilization's function.

Now, why would civilization not be possible without religion?

The Oxford dictionary definition of civilization is as follows:

&gt;The process by which a society or place reaches an advanced stage of social and cultural development and organization.

The key here is ""organization"". What makes Homo Sapiens unique is our ability to connect at scales not possible by any other animal on Earth. 

Civilization is essentially the output of networking more and more humans together to obtain more and more resources to support that ever-growing collection of humans.

Religions provide two key functions to the advancement of civilization:

* **Social Control:** Getting a large number of people to do something beneficial to a leader or a society as a whole
* **Social Cohesion:** Getting a large number of people to be civil with each other as result of a shared belief system and moral guidelines prohibiting anti-social behavior

Most species cannot sustain themselves in groups much larger than 150 people. There have been various studies that show this is the ideal size for human groups as well, as this is maximum size at which any one individual within the group can reasonably recognize and know every other member of the group.

Hunter-gatherer tribes existed within this constraint. At that stage, primitive religion (if you can call it that) simply consisted of imagining supernatural explanations for natural phenomena that they didn't have the tools or knowledge to explain. These supernatural forces were worshipped and given sacrifices to bargain for things that would help them survive, such as the end of a drought, or a big haul of fish or game.

What we know as ""morality"" was not a function of religion at that stage, because when everybody knows everybody else, the social cost is much more immediate when someone is caught stealing from their neighbor, or injuring and/or killing other members of the tribe. There would be nowhere to hide, and they would face immediate isolation or expulsion, which is practically a death sentence in those days.

Religion evolved to provide moral guidance once humans expanded the size of their groups to include more members than any one individual could reasonably know. At this point, deities and their edicts help enforce rules that stop strangers within a shared group from harming one another.

This begins to occur at the Chiefdom stage of civilization, but is most pronounced beginning in the ancient city-states, for example in Mesopotamia. 

Along the way, people who claim the ability to commune with the gods gain tangible power in their communities. In some cases, religious leaders are indistinguishable from political leaders. They often go hand in hand. 

Leaders leverage religion to get the unwieldy masses to get in line and do things that they might not otherwise do, such as giving political and religious leaders the output of their labor, their bodies to wage war, or even their bodies as sexual gratification.

The history of civilization is religion being used as a force to move a large number of humans to conquer new lands and assimilate new people, thus growing a larger network of interconnected people. It was also was used to build the greatest feats of human engineering and architecture, such as the pyramids of Egypt, and so forth.

For millennia, kings and queens gained and maintained their power due to a divine claim, which has its roots way back to the power attained by shamans within more primitive hunter-gatherer tribes.

As societies became increasingly complex with bureaucracies and hierarchies to structure government and society, that became reflected in their religions, as gods themselves became ordered in such hierarchies. New gods from conquered lands became part of the cosmic hierarchy.

This eventually led to the evolution of polytheism to monotheism, and a universalist morality that applied to all people on Earth, not simply individual tribes or nations. 

As there were more and more people interconnected across vast geographies, polytheism was less practical for maintaining social order and cohesion.

Looking through the Bible, you can still see the vestiges of Semitic polytheism strewn throughout it. It also explains the depiction of Yahweh in the Old Testament as a jealous and vengeful god, then morphing into a loving and caring god in the New Testament. It follows the cultural evolution of mankind who once did not view deities as entities that would look out for them, but rather as wrathful deities you tried to bargain with. 

Yahweh competed with all the other gods of the tribes and city-states within that region of the world, which is why there is so much about not worshipping idols or foreign gods, and why Yahweh was the god of the Jews, and not everyone else on the planet. At that time, monotheism didn't exist. The other gods were as real as theirs.

When Jesus came along, and Christianity took hold in the West, it infused a belief in the universal brotherhood of all mankind. No longer was Yahweh simply the God of the Jewish people, but was available for everyone in the world. Jesus' guidance toward caring for the poor and oppressed also became entwined with the culture moving forward, although often at a more surface level as clash of civilizations still led to bloodshed. Monotheism created a problem that didn't always exist with polytheism, in that monotheistic people desired to convert conquered people into their belief system, instead of simply assimilate foreign gods into their cosmic hierarchy of their belief system.

But still, that seed of universal human rights - the worth and value of every human no matter how far down the social ladder they were - would eventually lead to the Enlightenment ideals of universal human rights.

Secular law was now able to handle a lot of the load in maintaining social order that divine law once did. Yet, even still, the vestiges of religion as a social glue to maintain order remained, as even the US Constitution essentially ""backs up"" its legal authority in the divine. 

&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are **Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness**.

Are we finally reaching the stage of civilization at which religions are no longer needed to maintain social cohesion and enforce social control to get big things done?

We might be, but I'm not so sure. Secular governments tend not to have the same authority to get everybody within the society to get on board with big projects, even ones that might be required to maintain the species' survival, such as solving the issue of climate change.

And any secular government that does gain the kind of authority to get big things done can only do that due to brutal authoritarianism. That vengeful and wrathful god is replaced by a vengeful and wrathful political leader instead. And these governments are much more short-lived without their deities to back them up.

In the end, religion is a lot like oil. Whether you like or not, it helped get us to the place we are today, with all the benefits every one of us currently enjoys, while also causing a lot of damage along the way. 

Throughout history, religion has led to a beautiful tapestry of human creativity and ingenuity, but also to destruction. It has led to pro-social behaviors such as caring for the poor and downtrodden, but also to bloodshed and oppression.

Because without religion, we would have been incapable of organizing at the scale needed to do all of these things.",Civilization wouldn't be possible without religion,religion
27,"It seems most people who claim to be non-religious are Atheist, but it is not the case. [Many if not most of them are still spiritual, believe in some kind of God or Force.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/08/why-americas-nones-dont-identify-with-a-religion/) Even in heavily ""atheist"" countries such as the Netherlands or Japan or many former Soviet republic, this kind of Deist spirituality seems more common than Atheism itself, even when Atheism gets all the attention.

Another issue I find is that often many people who are not religious call themselves Atheists or Agnostics, but if you ask carefully they just mean non-religious, and they often believe in a God or have some kind of spirituality. This means they are just ignorant about what Atheism is.

Another issue is that many Atheists, usually Asian, are not materialists or naturalists. They believe in Luck, Karma, Reincarnation, etc. and often practice a non-theist religion such as (most of) Buddhism. I find it odd western atheists often use those numbers for their benefit, as often their main criticism of religion is supernaturalism itself.

It just seems odd that groups that are bigger than atheists in almost every atheist country are often ignored or put in the same bag as materialist atheists. 

My theory is that the idea of atheism in the East is very different from that of the West, and the difference is also vertical... common people do not understand theism and religion in the same way more educated religious and atheist people do. Sometimes the difference is astonishing.",Why is not Deism or non-religious Theism as visible as Atheism?,religion
28,"It seems some Atheists online often use the argument that you need to be an expert on the Bible, or read it all or be a devout religious person, as they claim that otherwise your belief is based on ignorance. The issue I have with this is that this view of religion is very modern, very sola-scriptura protestant, which is kind of ironic.

Their argument is that if you base your worldview on a religion, then you shall be an expert on it. The issue is that our worldviews are dynamic and influenced my a myriad things we are not experts on, not just one religion. It is like arguing against democracy because most Americans have never read the constitution, or most Leftists have not read Marx.

You do not need to be an expert on your religion to be a good believer, or even a subscriber of any ideology. Most religions can be summarized in a few dogmas or rules... from the eightfold path of Buddhism, to the 2 commandments as summarized by Jesus, Five Pillars of Islam, etc. Also most religions already have a cultural environment that teaches the basic values of the faith. For instance, in the West you do not need to be a Christian to know stealing or killing is bad, as those values are already in the culture and by following them you are already following part of most religions that ban murder, by inertia.

29,"My testimony, my conversion

So I already made a post where I briefly explained my conversion, but I will make a wider one now. 
(Premise, I was agnostic)
It all began in 2019, october, when I left my ex girlfriend. At the time I was 15, and leaving my girlfriend I found myself having a lot of free time. So I spent that time doing what I loved the most, listening to music. I was in love with the German band Faust at the time, so I decided to buy Goethe's Faust and read it. It changed my life, it brought my life into a nice existential chaos ands I was in love with it, I started listening even more music and thanks to covid I had even more free time so I started reading lots of books too. Until one day I realized that all music and books I've read were all talking about death. It was scary and sad, but the covid finished so I just forgot about it and started hanging out with my friends, get drunk for the first time, got weed for the first time, spent all the time with my friends getting high and drinking. Until one day I discovered the Supreme Dicks, my now favourite band, and the sound of their debut ""The unexamined life"" (my favourite album) brought to me those existential thoughts again, but I fell in deep depression. In September 2020 I met a girl that became my girlfriend. I was trying hard to love her but with depression is very very hard to love. I was so depressed that in January 2020 I attempted suicide and a friend saved my life. I started going to a psychologist but didn't help me a lot, but the psychologist anyway became a dear friend. In summer, I went in holiday with ma girl, we were abroad, in Switzerland so the internet didn't work. The holiday was unexpectedly good, and when I returned home and opened the phone I've discovered there was a war in Afghanistan. So, after a year without interests, I had an interest for the war. I started reading a lot about Afghanistan, Islam, religion, Christianity, physics, Jesus. I was reading a lot of things, spent my day and night reading articles over articles. And I noticed I was feeling a little better but I noticed I was also going crazy, like I was really lunatic, but happier than before so it was ok.
Until one day my gf as a prank sent me a link of an Italian conspiracy theorist who made a website explaining how Satanist freemason rule the world. reading that shit (don't know if it's true or no) I had a psychotic attack. Psychotic attack is like your soul being tortured, it's a physical pain but in the mind, it was horrible. They took me to the hospital and sent me home with a sleep potion and I finally slept. When I awoke everything was different. It was all peaceful and amazing, music was like never before and I became extremely good in videogames I sucked at, it felt like something beautiful and not human was possessing me, I called it a socratic demon. But the demon didn't last long, it lasted two weeks. When that good feeling was gone, in October 2021, I started feeling even more depressed than before. I left my girlfriend, I left school, was in bed all the time doing nothing. That until march 2022 when my psychiatrist gave me some antidepressants that at least made feel decently. So a friend was studying Socrates and was talking to me about the socratic demon, and I recalled that feeling of wellness I had.. I thought I wanted to have another psychotic attack to have the demon back, so I started reading a lot into r/conspiracy and was really going insane..until one day don't remember how I came across r/witchcraft. All the insanity I had collected went away. I was lucid. I was lucid because for the first time it didn't seem a stupid fake conspiracy. They seemed actually witches and wizards that made real magic. I thought magic was just in lord of the rings or videogames, but to be sure I tried to make some magics. Not gonna tell you what magics I did, (it's a dangerous matter) but they all worked and I was amazed by what I've discovered. So I told my friend (who's also my bandmate) and he believed me, so we tried to summon the deity shiva, offering hashish, to play for him. When we started playing, we started doing an insane improvisation like we never did before. so the day after we made the same thing. But we didn't record anything, thinking it was disrespectful. The day after I was alone and I made the ritual alone and Shiva finally appeared...well it wasn't shiva, it was the devil, Lucifer. He proposed me a deal to make with my friend, he would make me rich and famous in exchange for our soul in hell. I had to think about it so I said ""I'll tell you later"". The day after the devil came again and we talked all night long. I was in love with him, I was adoring him, I wanted to make the deal ASAP but I couldn't because there wasn't my friend with me. So brothers in Christ he kept saying me ""go to sleep, tomorrow is the great day"" but I couldn't sleep, I was so happy and excited to be with the devil. You see he appears like a creature of love and wisdom. So we started talking music, and I asked if he liked the supreme dicks. He said they suck. That's the exact moment I started to doubt him until I understood he was trying to trick me (having read Faust) and I started to ignore him(BECAUSE YOU CAN BE THE DEVIL HIMSELF BUT DON'T FUCKIN SAY SUPREME DICKS SUCK). But I didn't sleep and didn't want to sleep so I was also a lot exhaust and tired by all of this. I called my psychiatrist. I thought I was insane and schizophrenic. But I explained to her (she's an occult and religion expert) and she said that it was really Lucifer, and my guardian angel has like two big big balls. She said to pray saint Michael, and my God when I prayed Michael, the devil just fuckin got scared and went away. The day after I went to church and for the first time attended a mass and it was amazing, I decided from now on I will dedicate my life loving others and God. I will make music for God. Even tho he's scared, the devil's still here and I think I'll do an exorcism. Remember, the devil wants you to think that God wants you to suffer on earth, but that's untrue. God wants you to be happy on earth. And how? BY JUST FUCKIN LOVING GOD. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE BUDDHIST, ATHEIST OR CHRISTIAN, YOU HAVE TO SEARCH FOR YOUR GOD AND LOVE HIM AND YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT LIFE ON EARTH AND A GREATER LIFE WHEN YOU DIE.

* Religion is a drug that is best effective when your life is shit already. Losing it opens your eyes on the dark reality.
* Religion gives you emotional security that you are not alone, that someone in the sky is plotting your fate with love and care. Religious people think that atheists, especially ex-theists, throw that away, that they've abandoned their lord thus deserve to be depressed. Trust me, many of us would love to live in a world with a merciful God, but good things do not exist just because you think they do.
* How depressed you get highly depends on your community's acceptance readiness. Certain \*cough\* peaceful communities will make your life a hell on earth if you openly contradict them. Living with fear and limited freedom in a closet cripples your mind.

75," As an ex-atheist, I think I qualify to mediate, or side with both sides of the perennial argument on religion. I am a CSE student, and I believe in religion. For me, it is a belief that helps me power through difficult times, for me, it is something which keeps my inner demons away and let's me bring the best out of myself.

Of course, religious extremism and non-believers of science are a huge problem, the solution for that however, is not banning or restricting religion as a whole. Many religions need reforms, but outright banning them or controlling them is not the way forward. If such a thing is tried, it may threaten the very existence of humanity itself.

Only maniacs and delusional people believe that Gods and Goddesses are actually going to appear in their physical forms and save them from the seemingly, and self connivingly inevitable. They need to understand that divine forces exist, to help them achieve their goals, to help them provide a conscience, and to stay away from evil and to strive for good.

My religion, it doesn't matter which one it is, maybe I follow the path of Jesus, maybe I created my own religion! But why religion? Why do I need or want to follow religion? Why do I feel the need to pretend or believe that their exists a superior power that I must bow to, and respect? Why do I feel my religion defines a significant or insignificant part of me? It simply, dear readers, is a **matter of personal choice.**

But is the only thing stopping me from committing the unthinkable, yes both meanings, religion? Is religion hampering my belief in science? Is religion stopping me from being open minded? Is religion forcing me to force, and impose my thought process on others? Is religion the only thing stopping me from being evil?......... If you've asked yourself any of these questions and find yourself and your conscience biased towards the affirmative answer, you're not religious, you're a religious fanatic and quite possibly an extremist. The correct answer to any of the questions in this paragraph, is **no.**

In conclusion, religion and it's practices are not futile, yet they need to be checked for extremism and hatred, and if found, be abolished with haste. Intelligent youngsters, who are religious, and even atheist youngsters, must understand that excess of anything is harmful and must not be allowed to exist for extended periods of time.

When does the soul enter the body and when does it leave the body? 

According to science consciousness and individuality slowly develop (that makes sense) but if souls exist it must enter at some point and I don’t get at what point it would enter. 

And I’m not sure when it would exit the body either. Do people in vegetative states with very minimal brain function have a soul still? If not, when did it leave? And we’ve all heard of near death experiences. But why is it that the soul snaps back once we’ve been revived? Is it somehow tied to our active brain function like an anchor?

When you die, time relative to your point of view goes infinitely quickly, so as soon as you pass your consciousness is reborn into something else that is living, and from your perspective this process is instant.

110,"Lust is often considered a sin to Christians.  However, I can't seem to find any definitive evidence in the Bible of lust being a sin.  As a matter of fact, I can't even find any evidence in the Bible of the existence of lust as a concept.  Lust appears to be a somewhat vague concept with no clear definition, in the way that Christians use it; but I would personally define it as ""an intense meditation, fixation, obsession -- whether mentally or through physical action -- on sexual desire, sexual gratification, or sexual activity.""  But the thing is, there doesn't appear to be any word in the Bible, in the Hebrew or the Greek, which exactly corresponds to the English word ""lust,"" with all of its connotations.  

There appears to be a wide variety of Hebrew words used in the Old Testament which are translated into English as ""lust,"" although none of these words appear to specifically correlate with ""lust,"" per se.  And even so, the majority of uses of the word ""lust"" are in a metaphorical context in regards to Israel's ""adulterousness"" or ""harlotry"", as expressed through the prophets who condemn Israel's acts of idolatry. 

In the Greek of the New Testament, the verb *epithymeo* and the noun *epithymia* are typically the words that are translated into ""lust.""  *Epithymeo* is probably most famously used in Matthew 5:28, which is a verse commonly employed when discussing the subject of lust:

&gt;(KJV) But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman **to lust** after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

However, this word in the Greek is clearly not referring to the specifically sexual connotation of ""lust.""  This Greek word is used in contexts which are clearly not sexual in nature, such as Matthew 13:17,

&gt;(KJV) For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous \[men\] have **desired** to see \[those things\] which ye see, and have not seen \[them\]; and to hear \[those things\] which ye hear, and have not heard \[them\].

Luke 16:21,

&gt;(KJV) And **desiring** to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

 Luke 22:15,

&gt;(KJV) And he said unto them, With **desire** I have **desired** to eat this passover with you before I suffer:

Revelations 9:6, 

&gt;(KJV) And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall **desire** to die, and death shall flee from them.

and Acts 20:33.

&gt;(KJV) I have **coveted** no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

It is clear from these various uses that *epithymeo*/*epithymia* does not mean ""lust,"" but rather something like ""desire"", ""longing"", ""covet"", etc.  Even though words like desire, longing, and coveting are indeed related to lust, lust -- in the manner in which Christians and theologians use the term -- is clearly referring to something qualitatively different, specific, and unique.  It appears as if the Church has essentially invented a sin and then chosen to read this new sin into the Bible.  

As far as I know, the only ""thought-sin"" that is stipulated in the Bible is the sin of coveting another man's wife, as is stipulated in verses such as Exodus 20:17 and Matthew 5:28.  I know of no sin explicitly stipulated in the Bible which consists of merely the meditation/indulging upon sexual desire/sexual gratification by itself, irrespective of the specific object of desire.

111,"Before someone says, they're not exclusive: moment to moment a person chooses an evidence based approach to a problem or a faith based approach. So yes, a person can choose either in any given moment. The score is for which approach provided the most benefit

Religious people often point to their charity and welfare for the poor as a massive goodness campaign. They argue that the wars and inquisitions are more than compensated for in bringing morality and civilization to more primitive people. As the sole arbiters of morality, following the teaching of a religion makes people more moral and therefore spreading religion makes the world more moral

Science causes people to stop following religion and thus become less moral. Research provides evidence based claims for homosexuality, gun control, vaccination, and hurricanes not being caused by homosexuality, and therefore promotes immoral behavior. Science also invents more and more powerful weapons capable of killing more people more efficiently. But science has also dramatically raised the global expected lifespan and lowered the global infant mortality rate. It has dramatically reduced poverty and raised living conditions.

Scientific method has been a substantial force for about 400 years since the enlightenment and brought an unparalleled growth of literacy, economy, and health. Religion dominated society and government for at least 1400 years prior to the enlightenment and was considered the dark ages, marked by constant war, disease, famine, and death.

But there's one person credited with saving more lives than anyone in the history of mankind, by leaps and bounds. It wasn't Muhammad or Jesus. It was a man named Norman Borlaug. He was a geneticist who created dwarf wheat. Explanation: wheat originally had a limit to its yield since its stalk could only hold so much grain before collapsing and dying. Norman created wheat that grew shorter and therefore yielded much more grain, along with some other beneficial qualities. His version of wheat was introduced to farmers all over the world, dramatically increasing food availability to everyone. He's credited with saving a billion lives. He probably save more. And that's just one invention

Science has something that religion does not: demonstration. Research fails if it can not demonstrate its assertion. Religion doesn't fail whether or not it is true.

A quick clarification on definitions:

""Protected religion""- a government gives special perks, turns a blind eye to certain behaviors, openly espouses the views of, or publishes books for a religion. 

Let's go through a few common ones.

**Atheism-** Protected religion in China, North Korea, and certain Reddit threads. Can adopt holidays essentially based on ethnicity and culture.

**Christianity-** Protected religion (kind of) in America and South Korea, definitely a protected religion in the Vatican. Easier time understanding certain facets of European history. Christianity is also the most wide spread global religion, so it's a very good religion for travel. No matter where you go, there's a consistent community somewhere. Easier access to resources for learning ancient languages. Tremendously liberal dietary restrictions.

**Islam-** Protected religion in many middle eastern countries. Access to otherwise forbidden locations, including a portion of the TaJ Mahal. Islamic women are very unlikely to get a dress code violation in high school. The call to prayer in certain countries is helpful rather than annoying. Muslims often have a vague understanding of Arabic, so there's an advantage when travelling in Arabic speaking nations.

**Buddhism-** Protected religion in many southeast Asian countries. Many airports in Southeast Asia have special prayer rooms for Buddhist monks. Possibly the only religion that's basically universally accepted from India eastward, since it started in India but spread better in China.

**Hindu-** Protected religion in India. The richest parts of India conform to match a Hindu diet. 

**Judaism-** Protected religion in Israel. Very well-kept history and cultural knowledge dating back further than any other religion. Strong musical history that goes back thousands of years. 

**Sikhism-** Very unique style of apparel that stands out from anything else out there. I don't honestly know much else about Sikhs besides turbans and kirpans.

After about 4 hours of spooky stories we were starting to jump at every little thing. I was actually really enjoying myself because I like being scared but they were getting nervous nervous and started to lose focus on the work. So I decided it was a good time to break for lunch.

The three of us all got together in the cafeteria. The school was empty except the three of us and all the lunch tables were put away except the one we were sitting at. There are 4 double doors that are held open by electromagnets to the main hail ""the really haunted hall"" to the east. The north wall goes to the kitchen and the rest are large windows that gave us enough light that we kept the lights off.

128,"DISCLAIMER: I am not saying God works this way, But a speculation or an attempt to understand how a being who is not bound to time will function.

**We already know, at-least in Islam,** God is completely separate from his creation or in other words there is nothing to compare with him. In Quran in chapter 112 God told us ,

&gt;""Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He is Allah—One ˹and Indivisible˺. Allah—the Sustainer ˹needed by all˺. He has never had offspring, nor was He born. And there is none comparable to Him."" \[112\]

As there is nothing to compare, there is no way to comprehend how, what, why about God if he does not tell us. (we believe he told us about himself in Quran).

&gt;He is the First and the Last, the Most High and Most Near, and He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. \[57:3\]

He is not bound to anything and a timeless being, there is no beginning or end. Often we say God knows our future action, Or we ponder upon creation of humanity. This question is meaningful to us not so meaningful to God. In God watch (or whatever befitting to God) we already exist. To God There is nothing like eureka! Today I got a new idea.

**Take the moment of the creation of Adam**. First of all, In contrary to popular belief God is not in heaven. God is above everything.  There was no Heaven, God created it.

&gt;“Surely, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then rose over (istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty), disposing the affair of all  things.” \[10:3\]

When God created Adam he was not in God's realm rather inside heaven. Think about it again. Inside heaven means inside of a creation of God not in God's realm. All things we know about his creation is not in his realm. So I think if earth is the deepest level of isolation from God, then maybe one level closer to God is heaven. There can be many more isolation between God and Heaven. As far as I know even angel Gabriel (One of the top angels, carries messages of God) never perceive God.

**Another point,** If universe and everything stop now and then start again after 1 billion years later. We will not notice anything. Think about a computer which can perform 1 billion operations in one second. Suppose, Each operation means increasing 1 year in this universe. After one second God has all the result he wants. But As we are inside this universe, as We are going through each operation, we will feel and say that 1 year is a long time. Make that 1 second for God to instant. Now, everything happened and happening and will happen are in God's control. Now God can declare everything instantly with time parameter. Though everything happened instantly but because of those time value we perceive them sequentially at different time. Here is another verse about time people will feel at day of judgment day.

&gt;When the trumpet is sounded and We gather the sinful, sightless, they will murmur to one another, ‘You stayed only ten days \[on earth\]’. We know best what they say- but the more perceptive of them will say, ‘Your stay \[on earth\] was only a single day.’\[20:102-104\]

**God is a perfect being**, whatever he do is flawless. So creation of humankind (with defect) is a flawless idea  existed with God long before anything happened or Maybe always existed with God. Because his idea is flawless it does not require any correction at the mid point. The Idea is always correct. So whatever God intended to do with this universe or any creation is existed long ago, any incident happened in our life or anything existed long before (or always exists).

**Predestination is one of the six** pillars of Belief in Islam. So, It is a fundamental belief. Every matter is predestined. The position of earth in our universe is predestined, the color of sky or color of our skin are predestined to this way. I will be a poor person or I will buy a company or any other daily matters, maybe happened already . We are saying **will** to indicate a future action, because we are experiencing it this way. There is a hadith,

&gt;Ubada b. as-Samit reported God’s messenger as saying, “The first thing God created was the pen. He told it to write and when it asked Him what it should write He told it to write what was decreed, so it wrote what  had taken place and what would take place to all eternity.” [https://sunnah.com/mishkat:94](https://sunnah.com/mishkat:94)

**Summary:** Big bang, creation of adam, world wars and judgment day all this incidents are in God's watch (i couldn't find any better word), he knows everything, he has total control of it and total grasp of it first to last. But each incident has time function. Because we are inside this universe and bound with same time function, we perceive them at specific time and say that x amount of time has elapsed from incident A to incident B. Maybe all this incident and future incident already occurred in some timeless place.",Timeless God and our perception of time.,religion

141,"'m not denying there were classic pagans when Christianity raised, but I noticed most cults during the time had monotheistic or monolatric structures, specially during the transition into Christianity and in upper classes. We have Mithraism, Neo-platonism and Sol Invictus cult. I'm not saying those cults were monotheistic, but certainly they had a very monolatric taste. Not to mention that long before Greek Philosophers used to believe in the Gods but not the myths.

We also had Julian the apostate, which basically created the first neo-pagan religion as it was paganism but structured as the Christian church of the time. We also find that he basically was monotheistic (\[ref\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian\_(emperor)#cite\_note-104](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_(emperor)#cite_note-104))).

So it seems to me that Christianity itself just gave a face and a Jewish root to a monotheist trend that was already there, probably for centuries. It is reasonable to assume it was easy for most of them to adopt that religion. I assume the transition was not as traumatic as expected, except maybe in isolate parts of the empire and lower classes, where classic paganism was still literal and common.

Another issue I find is that first Christians themselves had no problem with this, as they used Greek terms and concept such as Logos is used in the Gospel of John.",Monotheism and Monolatry before Christianity in Classic Rome,religion

i am only 18, my whole life i have grew up christian, but stopped going to church at a young age. i definitely believe satan is real. however, i don’t believe IN him. i am very terrified of him and his evilness over the world. every time i trip, i feel like i can feel his presence, and it feels far much more real than life when i am sober. i don’t want nothing to do with him but i feel his presence. 

however, i don’t know what upper being is there to believe in or protect me. i almost don’t even know if one exists due to all the bad happening in the world. my faith has been completely destroyed over the years. is there a religion or is there a belief that is kinda like that? i don’t want to be a satanist, i don’t want to worship him.

i certainly believe that people who are white supremacists, terrorists, or anybody of that sort are controlled by satan or something evil. i don’t know how one could be so hateful towards individuals like that or do evil things.

143,"A few years ago I got involved in some Eco Village with a lot of interesting people some with interesting beliefs such as the thoughts that you could manifest reality 

That your thoughts or your attitude or your meditation practice could actually bend reality and make you get what you want in a positive or negative way 

This thinking has soo messed with my mind.
I had NO ocd traits whatsoever before this.
But when I believed this, I started believe I could also attract bad things, it become a cycle of toxic positivity, I didnt deal with ""negative"" emotions, shut them up instead and developed an eating disorder as a way to cope, I to this day struggling with eating disorders and also numb myself in other damaging ways, because I learned to numb my feelings for fear of them. 
If someone bad happens i jump straight to that it must be me attracting it (dark energy, curses, demons, djinn)
I made a post here in panic a few days ago. 
Im better now, today, but I have genuinly developed some scary thoughts and I attribute it to my new age days.

Yet, I have had people in my life who doesnt seem to have any negative outcome by this line of thinking, I have to ask, if there is anyone here who believe in this, is there something I am missing? Something I misunderstood?

I got this thought because I was watching a video by a muslim creator and an ad popped up, by mindvalley, who I remember that I used to watch before, I watched it and he went on in detail about how he now has 4 companies is because he learned to reach the Delta levels of the brain using a certain technique and he provided examples of others who had succed because of it as well.  

Is there any truth in this ? Or just snake oil? 

Any science on this ?

161,"In the lifespan of the universe, humanity barely registers as a blip. In the vastness of the universe, our galaxy is a mote of dust. If we got in the fastest theoretical spaceship that could ever exist and left now, we could never reach the edge of the observable universe. Of the matter that makes up the universe, we can only interact with 5% of it, the rest is dark matter. Of the spectrums of light, we can only see a very narrow portion. Same for hearing wavelengths of vibrations. The universe is infinitely large just as it is infinitely small and it is impossible for us to interact with the majority of it. All of our human history has taken place within a few miles of the surface of a single, small rock in space.

But even if we spread out across the galaxies, the universe isn't made for us, the atmospheric conditions and temperatures and magnetic poles and planet cores and planet composition of other planets are all anathema to carbon based life.

Even here on our own planet, there are diseases and viruses and insects and plagues that devastate us. Getting as far as we have under these conditions has been in spite of the world we live on, not because of it.

Reality is not like a watch, designed with meaning, meant to keep perfect time for a sentient observer. Reality is chaotic and our history is written in the minute but compounding compounding evolutionary changes that allowed us to randomly appear in a nearly infinite universe of possibilities and now we suffer from survivorship bias and an ego that tells us we exist for a reason, which is a necessary trait for survival.

So we struggle to survive in a competitive environment, trying to master nature in this hostile universe. We tell stories to explain our own existence, which themselves evolve to their most compelling versions which are maintained today by zealous people who use the social status their religion affords them to forget how small we all are.

Not that I have anything against that, when people don't use the tools of their religion to control others. What brings you peace is a good thing. And, here we are, conscious beings in a infinite universe. Maybe consciousness could manifest somewhere else, but I think consciousness itself is rather a small idea compared to the majesty of the universe. What need would God have for consciousness? So that he could express his importance, like we do? I think not. I like what it ways in the Tao Te Ching, that the Tao is like water, always flowing to the lowest place.

Honestly, I'm sure a lot of people could sympathize with me when I say that digging into certain areas that involve a lot of historical basis and debate that's been done for hundreds of years can be pretty daunting. Recently I've read a few interesting discussions around the debate between how the Biblical Canon was formed and how, and found that the discussion starts to get pretty deep pretty quickly. Arguments for and against change over time as new manuscripts are found, certain books in the deuterocanon are justified by the fact that canonical books reference them yet other books like 1 Enoch seemingly are excluded when the same principle applies, etc. There's tons of criteria and it's difficult to find sources of info that discuss both sides of the same issue when it comes to certain criteria so I'm finding it difficult to compare and contrast all these scattered points. 

As you guys know it's always easy to find a source that gives a good case for one side but pretty hard to find one that provides both sides. I've watched a few debates for that reason but knowing I have some reputable info of other formats would help focus my studying a lot so I don't end up wasting a ton of time on poorly sourced and biased junk before I realize it's a lot of nothing, you know?

A teen being sexually abused was found to be a cause of such incidences in the 70's. So does that mean that sexual abuse is also a form of dark magick? If so what does that mean about BDSM and abuse porn becoming really popular? What happens to a person at the center of poltergheist activity and is autism related to it?

I ask because Arabic speaking Christians and Jews use the term to refer to God too.

Is there a rational reason to make this assumption in your view? 

If so, what is that reason?

Personally I would just assume they were an Arabic speaker and monotheist, not  necessarily Muslim, unless they made a specifically Islamic claim about God/Allah.

247,"In fact ask yourself, ""who am I?"" and what is the source of this conciousness? This question is not meant to get an answer but to dissolve the questioner itself - for the questioner is illusory in the first place.

What you call ""you"" is nothing but a DREAMING - a collection of thoughts held together but desire and memory (which are also nothing but thought itself) creating the EXTREMELY persistent illusion that ""you"" are a separate thing that exists or that separate things exist. In reality, ONLY I EXISTS and that means exactly the same thing when ""you"" say it, ""I""or say it or any other conscious thing across the universe says it. 

A lot of confusion when talking about this stuff arises because words are very poor means of expressing and conveying ideas about reality. 

There's a Sanskrit expression which says: ""Neti - Neti"" or translated to English: ""not this - not that. That is to say ask yourself who am I and whatever conceptualized answer the mind comes up with, disregard it since conciousness can never know itself (in other words consciousness can never be an object in conciousness) in just the same way you cannot bite your own teeth.

You cannot put any label on  Pure Consciousness (even ""Pure Conciousness"" or ""God"" or anything else are just names and labels) since any label belongs to the mind and is understood by the mind and Pure Conciousness is beyond and prior to mind/thought.

You can use to mind to intellectually understand that ""you"" as a separate person never existed but to actually know that 


YOU are Pure Witnessing/ Pure Being (another label lol but look at what the word is trying to point to) . YOU are God - you won't REALIZE this until ""you"" or in other words this identity held together by thoughts and memory doesn't dissolve. 

Silent the mind and know your real nature. (Or ""Be Still and know that I Am God"" lol).","I cannot show you GOD because GOD is the SEER - UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS AND ""FIND GOD""",religion
